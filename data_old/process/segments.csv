The Circe Saga,Done For,ODYSSEUS,"Lady of the palace, sorry that I ask this

But I hope that I've been misinformed

I sent out some scouts to take a look around through

Here and they wound up at your door

Through the years we seldom

Get a warm welcome, so

I must ask just to be sure

Did you do something to them?"
The Circe Saga,Done For,CIRCE,"Who, me?

All I did was reveal their true forms"
The Circe Saga,Done For,ODYSSEUS,You turned them into pigs
The Circe Saga,Done For,CIRCE,"Huh

I don't know who you are nor why you're here

But let me make this one thing clear

I've got people to protect

Nymphs I can't n?glect

So I'm not taking chances, dear

If you mak? one wrong move, then you're done for

Anything I don't approve, then you're done for

I could put a spell on you and you're done for

Boy, you better run or soon you will done for"
The Circe Saga,Done For,ODYSSEUS,"I don't mean to tip your scale but

You will fail at

Placing any spells on me

I just ate a flower

One that claims your power

So you better cower now and flee"
The Circe Saga,Done For,CIRCE,"You must be a liar

Mortals can't acquire

Moly without dire consequence"
The Circe Saga,Done For,ODYSSEUS,"Then I must be a god like you

Cause I got this root from the ground with my bare hands"
The Circe Saga,Done For,CIRCE,"Hermes gave it to you, didn't he?"
The Circe Saga,Done For,ODYSSEUS,"Okay, fine, yes, but regardless"
The Circe Saga,Done For,ODYSSEUS,"You and I are now evenly matched

Our fates are intertwined, they're attached"
The Circe Saga,Done For,"ODYSSEUS, CIRCE","I've got people to protect, friends I can't neglect

So now there is no turning back

You've made your one wrong move, now you're done for

I will be the one to prove that you're done for

Not even a spell saves you, cause you're done for

Oh, you better run or soon you will be done for"
The Circe Saga,Done For,ODYSSEUS,You've lost
The Circe Saga,Done For,CIRCE,"My nymphs are like my daughters

I protect them at all costs

The last time we let strangers live

We faced a heavy loss

You've given me no reason to

Bestow you with my trust

But everyone's true colours are

Revealed in acts of lust"
The Circe Saga,Done For,ODYSSEUS,I'm not sure I follow
The Circe Saga,Puppeteer,EURYLOCHUS,"Captain, I have something that I must confess

Something that I must get off my chest

Until it is said, I cannot rest

Captain?"
The Circe Saga,Puppeteer,ODYSSEUS,"Eurylochus, go make sure this island is secure"
The Circe Saga,Puppeteer,EURYLOCHUS,But captai
The Circe Saga,Puppeteer,ODYSSEUS,"There's only so much left we can endure

Whatever you need to say can wait some more

Of that, I'm sure"
The Circe Saga,Puppeteer,EURYLOCHUS,Okay
The Circe Saga,Puppeteer,EURYLOCHUS,"Sir, since we left home we've faced a variety of foes from a wide range of places

Gods, monsters, you know the roster, hostile creatures that we could resist

But this was a h?ll of a twist, cause we are w?ak to a power like this"
The Circe Saga,Puppeteer,ODYSSEUS,What was it?
The Circe Saga,Puppeteer,EURYLOCHUS,A woman
The Circe Saga,Puppeteer,ODYSSEUS,What?
The Circe Saga,Puppeteer,EURYLOCHUS,She had us in just two words
The Circe Saga,Puppeteer,CIRCE,Come inside
The Circe Saga,Puppeteer,ODYSSEUS,Damn
The Circe Saga,Puppeteer,CIRCE,"Welcome to the best part of your lives

Go ahead and rest wherever you like

I got you, don't worry Circe's got you now"
The Circe Saga,Puppeteer,EURYLOCHUS,"Only I stayed outside, but the rest went in"
The Circe Saga,Puppeteer,CIRCE,"Take a seat

Let me bring you all something to eat

I bet you're tired from the years spent on your feet

I got you, don't worry Circe's got you now"
The Circe Saga,Puppeteer,EURYLOCHUS,"By the time they ate, it was far too late"
The Circe Saga,Puppeteer,"EURYLOCHUS, CIRCE","For inside the meal, think of your past

She had cast a spell, and your mistakes

They began to squeal, they'll be the last

And grow snouts and tails, mistakes you'll make

She changed them"
The Circe Saga,Puppeteer,CIRCE,"I got all the power, yeah, I got all the power

No, I'm not a player, I'm a puppeteer

No, I don't play, I puppeteer, yeah"
The Circe Saga,Puppeteer,"EURYLOCHUS, CIRCE","They transformed, this is the price

And it wasn't quick, we pay to live

She turned our men, the world does not

From men to pigs, tend to forgive

She changed them"
The Circe Saga,Puppeteer,CIRCE,"I got all the power, yeah, I got all the power

No, I'm not a player, I'm a puppeteer

No, I don't play, I puppeteer, yeah"
The Circe Saga,Puppeteer,ODYSSEUS,We have to go save them
The Circe Saga,Puppeteer,EURYLOCHUS,"No we don't

Look at all we've lost and all we've learned

Every single cost is so much more than what we've earned

Think about the men we have left before there's none

Let's just cut our losses, you and I, and let's run"
The Circe Saga,Puppeteer,ODYSSEUS,"Of course I'd like to leave now, of course I'd like to run

But I can hardly sleep now knowing everything we've done

There's no length I wouldn't go if it was you I had to save

I can only hope you'd do the same"
The Circe Saga,There Are Other Ways,CIRCE,"There are other ways of persuasion

There are other modes of control

There are other means of deceit

There are other roads to the soul

There are other actions of passion

You have so much left to learn

Want to save your men from the fire?

Show me that you're willing to burn, woah"
The Circe Saga,There Are Other Ways,"ODYSSEUS, CIRCE","Who's to say, with the mistakes I've made, Don't be afraid

That they will be th? last Think of your past

Mistakes I ever mak?? Don't break when"
The Circe Saga,There Are Other Ways,"CIRCE, ODYSSEUS, BOTH","There is so much power, so much power

But there's no puppet here, here"
The Circe Saga,There Are Other Ways,"CIRCE, ODYSSEUS","This is the price we pay to love, I'm just a man

There is no line never enough, I'm just a man

So much power, so much power, forgive me

But there's no puppet here"
The Circe Saga,Wouldn't You Like,HERMES,
The Circe Saga,Wouldn't You Like,HERMES,"I must say, what a brilliant speech you gave"
The Circe Saga,Wouldn't You Like,ODYSSEUS,Who goes there?
The Circe Saga,Wouldn't You Like,HERMES,"Just a friend who could help you save your men

A foe like Circe's not to be messed with

You want to beat her?

You'll need the blessing of a certain god

Divine intervention

Someone who's not afraid to send a message"
The Circe Saga,Wouldn't You Like,ODYSSEUS,Hermes?
The Circe Saga,Wouldn't You Like,HERMES,
The Circe Saga,Wouldn't You Like,HERMES,"Wouldn't you like a taste of the power?

Wouldn't you like to use more than words?

Deep in the night, the fight lasts for hours

You can be hurt or you can beat her

Wouldn't you like to hav? some of the magic?

Wouldn't you like your outcom? preferred?

Deep in the night, the fight can be tragic

I'll help you conquer her

She can turn you to an animal

That'll end up on her plate

She can all but make you fall in love

Like you're on your hundredth date

She can conjure up a monster

That'll grind you to the bones

She has all the ways to haunt ya

When you take her on alone"
The Circe Saga,Wouldn't You Like,"HERMES, ENSEMBLE","Wouldn't you like a taste of the power?

Wouldn't you like to use more than words?

Deep in the night, the fight can be tragic

I'll help you conquer her"
The Circe Saga,Wouldn't You Like,HERMES,"Oh-oh

Here in the root of this flower

There lies such a power to take her on

You must consume and digest it

Then you'll manifest a being of your creation

All you need's imagination

Though it's only for a moment

Till you've beaten your opponent"
The Circe Saga,Wouldn't You Like,HERMES,"And I call this root ""holy moly"""
The Circe Saga,Wouldn't You Like,ODYSSEUS,Ah

The Circe Saga,Wouldn't You Like,HERMES,"Don't thank me, friend, you very well may die

Mh-hm-hm, good luck"
The Cyclops Saga,My Goodbye,"ATHENA, ODYSSEUS","You were reckless, sentimental at best

That's not a teaching of mine

You’ve grown soft, your dead friends can attest

Hey!

Put your emotions aside

You're a warrior meant to lead the rest

I don't know where I went wrong

But I warned ya’, and you failed the test

So now I'm gone

This way, you'll know what your place is

This way, you can't cross the line

This way, when all is over you'll keep yours and I'll keep mine

This way, you won't disappoint me

This way, you won't waste my time

This way, I’ll close the door

Consider this as my goodbye"
The Cyclops Saga,My Goodbye,ODYSSEUS,"That’s just lik? you, why should I be surprised?

Selfish and prid?ful and vain

Unlike you, every time someone dies

I'm left to deal with the strain

What’s a title that a goddess could lend if I'll never sleep at night?

I'll remind you I saw you as a friend

But now we're done

This way, you’re out of my head now

This way, you won't plague my life

This way, when all is done, you're out of sight and out of mind

This way, you get what you wanted

This way, you can save your time

This way, you close the door and have your damn goodbye"
The Cyclops Saga,My Goodbye,ATHENA,"You're not looking for a mentor

I'm not looking for a friend

I mistook you for a general

What a waste of effort spent"
The Cyclops Saga,My Goodbye,ODYSSEUS,"At least I know what I'm fighting for

While you're fighting to be known

Since you claim you're so much wiser

Why's your life spent all alone?

You're alone"
The Cyclops Saga,My Goodbye,ATHENA,"One day, you'll hear what I'm saying

One day, you might understand

One day, but not today, for after all you're"
The Cyclops Saga,My Goodbye,ENSEMBLE,Just a man
The Cyclops Saga,My Goodbye,"ATHENA, ENSEMBLE","This day, you sever your own head

This day, you cut the line

This day, you lost it all

Consider this as my goodbye

Ohh

Consider this as my goodbye

Ohh

This is my goodbye

Ohh

Consider this as my goodbye

Ohh

This is my goodbye"
The Cyclops Saga,Polyphemus,ODYSSEUS,Over here!
The Cyclops Saga,Polyphemus,POLITES,"Look at all this food, look at all these sheep

I can't believe this cave has all this for us to keep"
The Cyclops Saga,Polyphemus,EURYLOCHUS,"I've gotta hand it to you both, this is quite the treat

There are enough sheep here to feed the entire fleet"
The Cyclops Saga,Polyphemus,ODYSSEUS,"It's almost too perfect, too good to be true

Why would the lotus eaters pass up on all this food?"
The Cyclops Saga,Polyphemus,POLYPHEMUS,Who are you?
The Cyclops Saga,Polyphemus,ODYSSEUS,"Hey there

We're just travellers

We come in peace"
The Cyclops Saga,Polyphemus,POLYPHEMUS,"You killed my sheep

My favourit? sheep

What gives you the right to deal a pain so deep

Don't you know that pain you sow is pain you r?ap?

Time to drink

Your blood over where you stand

Your life now is in my hand

Before I'm done

You will learn that it's not so fun to take

You came to my home to steal

But now you'll become my meal

A trade, you see?

Take from you like you took from me"
The Cyclops Saga,Polyphemus,ODYSSEUS,"There's been a misunderstanding

We never came here to steal

But now that I see we've done some damage

Maybe you and I can make a deal

I'll give you our finest treasure

So long as we leave alive

You can keep the world's best tasting wine"
The Cyclops Saga,Polyphemus,POLYPHEMUS,Wine?
The Cyclops Saga,Polyphemus,ODYSSEUS,"Have a drink

One sip and you'll understand

The power that's in your hands

A wine so fresh

You'd never wanna eat human flesh again

Then we shall be on our way

No bloodshed in here today

A trade, you see?

A gift from you and a gift from me"
The Cyclops Saga,Polyphemus,POLYPHEMUS,"Ah, I'd like to thank you

Stranger, what's your name?"
The Cyclops Saga,Polyphemus,ODYSSEUS,"My name is Nobody, Nobody, Nobody"

Watch out!"
The Cyclops Saga,Remember Them,EURYLOCHUS,"Captain!

Captain!

Captain!"
The Cyclops Saga,Remember Them,ODYSSEUS,"We must move quickly, we don't have much time

He didn't notice I mixed lotus in his wine

Mark my words now, this is not the end"
The Cyclops Saga,Remember Them,EURYLOCHUS,"But captain, what'll we do with our fallen friends?"
The Cyclops Saga,Remember Them,"ODYSSEUS, SOLDIERS","Remember them

When the fire begins to fade

For the fallen and afraid

We are not to let them die in vain

Remember them

We're the ones who carry on

The flames of those who've gone

And our comrades will not die in vain"
The Cyclops Saga,Remember Them,ODYSSEUS,"I need all our hands on his club

This is how we're getting out of here

Use your swords to sharpen the stub

And turn it to a giant spear"
The Cyclops Saga,Remember Them,SOLDIERS,Let's kill him!
The Cyclops Saga,Remember Them,ODYSSEUS,"His body is blocking the path

If we kill him we'll be stuck inside"
The Cyclops Saga,Remember Them,EURYLOCHUS,"Captain, where do we attack him?"
The Cyclops Saga,Remember Them,ODYSSEUS,We gotta stab him in the eye
The Cyclops Saga,Remember Them,SOLDIERS,"Yes sir

Remember them

When the fire begins to fade

For the fallen and afraid

We are not to let them die in vain"

The Cyclops Saga,Remember Them,ATHENA,"Have you forgotten the lessons I taught you?

He's still a threat until he's dead

Finish it"
The Cyclops Saga,Remember Them,ODYSSEUS,No
The Cyclops Saga,Remember Them,ATHENA,No?
The Cyclops Saga,Remember Them,ODYSSEUS,"What good would killing do

When mercy is a skill more of this world could learn to use

My friend is dead, our foe is blind

The blood we shed, it never dries

Is this what it means to be a warrior of the mind?"
The Cyclops Saga,Remember Them,ATHENA,Don't!
The Cyclops Saga,Remember Them,ODYSSEUS,"Hey, Cyclops!

When we met, I led with peace

While you fed your inner beast

But my comrades will not die in vain

Remember them

The next time that you dare choose not to spare

Remember them

Remember us

Remember me

I am neither man nor mythical

I am your darkest moment

I am the infamous

The Cyclops Saga,Survive,"ODYSSEUS, SOLDIERS","No backup, no chance for support

So draw out your swords

Our foe must be thwarted right here and now

Show me how great is your will to survive

Six hundred lives at stake

It's just one life to take

And when we kill him then our journey’s over

No dying on me now

Defeat is not allowed

We must live through this day so

Fight, fight, fight

Surround him, surround him

Attack from behind, keep distance in mind

And stay in his blindspot and strike his heels, strike the heels

Show him that we're deadly, ha, ha

Exhaust him, exhaust him

Don't let him get close, he's strong but he's slow

He can't land a blow if we're out of reach

Find a breach

Stand up and fight for your lives"
The Cyclops Saga,Survive,"SOLDIERS, ODYSSEUS","Six hundred lives at stake

Don't you know the prince is not around

I heard he's on a diplomatic mission

And I heard today he comes back to town, so

I say we gather near the beaches

I say we wait 'til he arrives

Then, when he docks his ship, we can breach it

Let us leave now, today we can strike and"

The Ithaca Saga,I Can’t Help But Wonder,TELEMACHUS,"Father?

All my life, I'd have died to meet you

Thought about your name so much it hurts

For twenty years I'd dreamt of how I'd greet you

Oh, and now you're here

I can't find the words

All my life I'd have died to know you

Days and nights I wish that I could show you

For twenty years I never could outgrow you

Oh, and now you're here

I can't help but wonder

What your world must be

If we're like each other

If I have your strength in me

I can't help but feel like

Sorrow's all I've known

And I can't help but realize

For so long I've felt alone"
The Ithaca Saga,I Can’t Help But Wonder,ODYSSEUS,"Oh my son, look how much you've grown

Oh my boy, the sweetest joy I've known

Twenty years ago I held you in my arms

How time has flown, oh

Used to say I'd make the storm clouds cry for you

Used to say I'd capture wind and sky for you

Held you in my arms prepared to die for you, oh

How times has flown

I can only wonder

What your world has been

Things you've had to suffer

And the strength you hold within

All I've ever wanted

Was to reunite with my own

20 years we've wandered

But today you're not alone

My son, I'm finally home!"
The Ithaca Saga,Odysseus,SUITORS,"In the heat of battle at the edge of the unknown

Somewhere in the shadows lurks an agile deadly foe

We have the advantage, we've the numbers and the might

No, you don't understand it. This man plans for every fight

Where is he? Where is he?

Keep your head down, he's aiming for the torches

Our weapons, they're missing!

He's using the darkness to hide his approaches

We're empty handed up against an archer

Our only chance is to strike him in the darkness

We know these halls, the odds can be tilted"
The Ithaca Saga,Odysseus,ODYSSEUS,"You don't think I know my own palace?

I built it"

The Ithaca Saga,The Challenge,PENELOPE,"I'm supposed to choose a suitor to wear the crown

I said I would choose as soon as I weave this shroud

They don't know

That every night

I unthread all the work I've done

Cause I'd rather lie Than allow them to think they've won

Though I never thought I would resort to this

Just know I'll be here

Though I don't know how much longer I'll last

Since we saw that storm

And though it was so close to our kingdom

It was far from the norm

Unless

Oh, could it be some kind of sign

That my world is all about to change?

Is it finally time for the challenge I arranged?

Though I never thought that it would come to this

Just know I'll be here buying you time"

And shoot through 12 axes cleanly

Will be the new king, sit down at the throne

And rule with me as their queen

Cause I'd rather die than grow old without the best of you

Though I never thought that these would be the lengths we'd go for love

I would not have it any other way

And though I never thought that it would end like this

Just know, I'll be here

Waiting, waiting"

The Ithaca Saga,Would You Fall In Love With Me Again,PENELOPE,"Is it you? Have my prayers been answered?

Is it really you standing there, or am I dreaming once more?

You look different, your eyes look tired

Your frame is lighter, your smile torn

Is it really you, my love?"
The Ithaca Saga,Would You Fall In Love With Me Again,ODYSSEUS,"I am not the man you fell in love with

I am not the man you once adored

I am not your kind and gentle husband

And I am not the love you knew before

Would you fall in love with me again

If you knew all I've done?

The things I cannot change

Would you love me all the same?

I know that you've been waiting, waiting for love"
The Ithaca Saga,Would You Fall In Love With Me Again,PENELOPE,What kinds of things did you do?
The Ithaca Saga,Would You Fall In Love With Me Again,ODYSSEUS,"Left a trail of red on every island

As I traded friends like objects, I could use

Hurt more lives than I can count on my hands

But all of that was to bring me back to you

So tell me

Would you fall in love with me again

If you knew all I've done?

The things I can't undo

I am not the man you knew

I know that you've been waiting, waiting"
The Ithaca Saga,Would You Fall In Love With Me Again,PENELOPE,"If that's true, could you do me a favor?

Just a moment of labor that would bring me some peace

See that wedding bed? Could you carry it over?

Lift it high on your shoulders and take it far away from here"
The Ithaca Saga,Would You Fall In Love With Me Again,ODYSSEUS,"How could you say this?

I had built that wedding bed with my blood and sweat

Carved it into the olive tree where we first met

A symbol of our love everlasting

Do you realize what you have asked me?

The only way to move it is to cut it from its roots"
The Ithaca Saga,Would You Fall In Love With Me Again,PENELOPE,"Only my husband knew that

So I guess that makes him you"
The Ithaca Saga,Would You Fall In Love With Me Again,ODYSSEUS,Penelope
The Ithaca Saga,Would You Fall In Love With Me Again,PENELOPE,"I will fall in love with you over and over again

Under my spell, we're stuck in paradise

No one can come nor go, my island stays unknown"
The Wisdom Saga,Love in Paradise,ODYSSEUS,"No, no

I don't belong here

There's something wrong here

I won't be drawn to love in paradise

Not till the end of time, there is no way"
The Wisdom Saga,Love in Paradise,CALYPSO,"You're mine, all mine"
The Wisdom Saga,We’d Be Fine,TELEMAHCUS,"I don't know who this friend is

Or if he's worth the hype but

My time with you has been splendid

The best day of my life

Cause I got in a fight, sailed to an island

When I've never left home shores

You're the friend I've never had before

And so I think maybe, if life wasn't spent as planned

Maybe, it's time that you lend a hand

I don't think he'll mind

If not his friend then mine"
