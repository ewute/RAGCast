Not Sorry For Loving You

 [CALYPSO]

Someone arrived today

They said they're taking you away

That you're not mine to save

And soon I won't get to see your face

So I came by to say

You're unlike anyone I have ever?known

'Cause?you're?all I've ever?known

And if I?pushed you

Or if I came on too strong

Or if I ambushed you

For that, I'll say I was wrong

And if you hate me

Then I am sorry my love's too much for you

[CALYPSO, ENSEMBLE]

But I'm not sorry for loving you

I'm not sorry for loving you

I'm not sorry for loving you

I'm not sorry for loving you

[ODYSSEUS]

Calypso

[CALYPSO]

Let me speak

I spent my whole life here

Was cast away when I was young

Alone for a hundred years

I had no friends but the sky and sun

So when you washed ashore

I thought for sure that you were my dream come true

I thought I knew

[CALYPSO, ENSEMBLE]

So if I pushed you

Or if I came on too strong

Or if I ambushed you

For that, I'll say I was wrong

And if you hate me

Then I am sorry my love's too much for you

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

But I'm not sorry for loving you

I'm not sorry for loving you

I'm not sorry for loving you

I'm not sorry for loving you

[CALYPSO]

I'm not sorry

I'm angry and tired and restless and sad

I'm stuck in the moments I swore that we had

I wish you would chase me

Or try to embrace me

For once, I wish you would lie and say

[ODYSSEUS]

I love you

[CALYPSO]

You do?

[ODYSSEUS]

But not in the way that you want me to

[CALYPSO, ENSEMBLE]

I hate that I fell in love with you

Hate that I fell in love with you

Why did I fall in love with you?

Why did I fall in love with you?

What do I do with this love for you?

What do I do with this love for you?

How am I supposed to get over you?

How am I supposed to get over you?

Why in the world won't you love me too?
