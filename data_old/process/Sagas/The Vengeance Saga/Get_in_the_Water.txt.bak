Get in the Water

            [POSEIDON, spoken]


There you are, coward


[POSEIDON]


I've been waiting for this moment


For the perfect time to strike


When your?home's?so close


And you've?reached your coast


That's when our paths?collide


I've got a reputation


I've got a name to uphold


So I can't go letting you walk or else the world forgets I'm cold


Now get in the water


Get in the water


Or I'll raise the tide so high, all of Ithaca will die


Get in the water


[ODYSSEUS]


Wait


[POSEIDON]


Get in the water


[ODYSSEUS]


Stop this, please


[POSEIDON]


I'll make tidal waves so profound


Both your wife and your son will drown


[ODYSSEUS]


NO


[POSEIDON]


Get in the water


Get in the water


Don't mistake my threats for bluff


You have lived more than enough


Get in the water


Get in the water


I'll take your son and gouge his eyes


That is, unless you choose to die


Get in the water


[ODYSSEUS]


Aren't you tired, Poseidon?


It's been 8 years, how long will this go?


We're both hurting from losses


So why not leave this here and just go home?


[Poseidon, spoken]


No


Ruthlessness is mercy upon ourselves


Die
