Polyphemus

            [ODYSSEUS, spoken]


Over here!


[POLITES]


Look at all this food, look at all these sheep


I can't believe this cave has all this for us to keep


[EURYLOCHUS]


I've gotta hand it to you both, this is quite the treat


There are enough sheep here to feed the entire fleet


[ODYSSEUS]


It's almost too perfect, too good to be true


Why would the lotus eaters pass up on all this food?


[POLYPHEMUS]


Who are you?


[ODYSSEUS, spoken]


Hey there


We're just travellers


We come in peace


[POLYPHEMUS]


You killed my sheep


My favourit? sheep


What gives you the right to deal a pain so deep


Don't you know that pain you sow is pain you r?ap?


Time to drink


Your blood over where you stand


Your life now is in my hand


Before I'm done


You will learn that it's not so fun to take


You came to my home to steal


But now you'll become my meal


A trade, you see?


Take from you like you took from me


[ODYSSEUS]


There's been a misunderstanding


We never came here to steal


But now that I see we've done some damage


Maybe you and I can make a deal


I'll give you our finest treasure


So long as we leave alive


You can keep the world's best tasting wine


[POLYPHEMUS]


Wine?


[ODYSSEUS]


Have a drink


One sip and you'll understand


The power that's in your hands


A wine so fresh


You'd never wanna eat human flesh again


Then we shall be on our way


No bloodshed in here today


A trade, you see?


A gift from you and a gift from me


[POLYPHEMUS]


Ah, I'd like to thank you


Stranger, what's your name?


[ODYSSEUS]


My name is Nobody, Nobody, Nobody


[POLYPHEMUS]


Nobody, for your gift I've one to reply


[ODYSSEUS]


I'm so glad we see eye to eye


[POLYPHEMUS]


Yes, you shall be the final man to die


[ODYSSEUS, spoken]


What?


Watch out!
