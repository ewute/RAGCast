Remember Them

            [EURYLOCHUS]


Captain!


Captain!


Captain!


[ODYSSEUS]


We must move quickly, we don't have much time


He didn't notice I mixed lotus in his wine


Mark my words now, this is not the end


[EURYLOCHUS]


But captain, what'll we do with our fallen friends?


[ODYSSEUS, ODYSSEUS & SOLDIERS]


Remember them


When the fire begins to fade


For the fallen and afraid


We are not to let them die in vain


Remember them


We're the ones who carry on


The flames of those who've gone


And our comrades will not die in vain


[ODYSSEUS]


I need all our hands on his club


This is how we're getting out of here


Use your swords to sharpen the stub


And turn it to a giant spear


[SOLDIERS]


Let's kill him!


[ODYSSEUS]


His body is blocking the path


If we kill him we'll be stuck inside


[EURYLOCHUS]


Captain, where do we attack him?


[ODYSSEUS]


We gotta stab him in the eye


[SOLDIERS]


Yes sir


Remember them


When the fire begins to fade


For the fallen and afraid


We are not to let them die in vain


[ODYSSEUS, SOLDIERS]


Remember them


We're the ones who carry on


The flames of those who've gone


And our comrades will not die in vain


[ODYSSEUS]


Now!


Scatter!


[CYCLOPES]


Who hurts you?


[EURYLOCHUS, spoken]


There are more of them?


[CYCLOPES]


Who hurts you?


[ODYSSEUS, spoken]


Hide


[CYCLOPES]


Who hurts you?


[EURYLOCHUS]


Captain, we should run


[ODYSSEUS]


Wait


[CYCLOPES]


Who hurts you?


[EURYLOCHUS]


Captain, please


[ODYSSEUS]


Wait


[POLYPHEMUS]


It was Nobody, Nobody


[CYCLOPES]


If nobody hurts you, be silent


[POLYPHEMUS]


Don’t go!


[ODYSSEUS]


Let's grab the sheep and away we go


[ATHENA]


Have you forgotten the lessons I taught you?


He's still a threat until he's dead


Finish it


[ODYSSEUS]


No


[ATHENA]


No?


[ODYSSEUS]


What good would killing do


When mercy is a skill more of this world could learn to use


My friend is dead, our foe is blind


The blood we shed, it never dries


Is this what it means to be a warrior of the mind?


[ATHENA]


Don't!


[ODYSSEUS]


Hey, Cyclops!


When we met, I led with peace


While you fed your inner beast


But my comrades will not die in vain


Remember them


The next time that you dare choose not to spare


Remember them


Remember us


Remember me


I'm the reigning king of Ithaca


I am neither man nor mythical


I am your darkest moment


I am the infamous


Odysseus
