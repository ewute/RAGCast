Survive

 [ENSEMBLE]

Po-ly-phe-mus

Po-ly-phe-mus

[ODYSSEUS]

My brothers

The rest of our fleet

They wait at the beach

And if we're defeated, they’re good as dead

Straight ahead, that is who we're fighting

[ENSEMBLE]

Po-ly-phe-mus

[ODYSSEUS, SOLDIERS]

No backup, no chance for support

So draw out your swords

Our foe must be thwarted right here and now

Show me how great is your will to survive

Six hundred lives at stake

It's just one life to take

And when we kill him then our journey’s over

No dying on me now

Defeat is not allowed

We must live through this day so

Fight, fight, fight

Surround him, surround him

Attack from behind, keep distance in mind

And stay in his blindspot and strike his heels, strike the heels

Show him that we're deadly, ha, ha

Exhaust him, exhaust him

Don't let him get close, he's strong but he's slow

He can't land a blow if we're out of reach

Find a breach

Stand up and fight for your lives

[SOLDIERS, ODYSSEUS]

Six hundred lives at stake

It's just one life to take

And when we kill him then our journey’s over

Push forward

No dying on us now

Defeat is not allowed

We must live through this day so

Fight, fight, fight

[POLITES]

Captain…

[POLYPHEMUS]

Enough

[SOLDIER]

He’s got a club…

He's got a club!

[SOLDIER]

What are our orders?

Captain? Captain!

[POLYPHEMUS]

You’ve hurt me enough

Six hundred lives I'll take

Six hundred lives I'll break

And when I kill you then my pain is over

You're dying here and now

Escape is not allowed

You won’t live through this day now die

Die...
