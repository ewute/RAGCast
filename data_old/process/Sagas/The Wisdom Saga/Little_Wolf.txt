Little Wolf

 [ANTINUOUS, THE SUITORS]

Fight, little wolf, fight

Wanna entertain me?

Bite, little wolf, bite

Let's see how you take this

Strike, little wolf, strike

Wanna be a man? Then

Fight, little wolf, fight, little wolf, fight

You've made your worst mistake here, might be your last one too

You'll have run out of bones to break when you and I are through

I'll teach you all the lessons your daddy never could

This cruel world doesn't give out presents just for being good

So

Fight, little wolf, fight

Wanna entertain m??

Bite, little wolf, bite

L?t's see how you take this

Strike, little wolf, strike

Wanna be a man? Then

Fight, little wolf, fight, little wolf, fight

Or die, little wolf, die

Don't you know it's fight or

Fly, little wolf, fly

All because you had to

Try, little wolf try

Run away before you

Die, little wolf, die, little wolf, die
