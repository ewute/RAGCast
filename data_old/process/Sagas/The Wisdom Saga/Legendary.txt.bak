Legendary

            [TELEMACHUS]


It's just me, myself, and I


Stuck in my bedroom, living in this world you left behind


Dreaming of all these monsters that I'll never get to fight


But boy, I wish I could, so I could bring this world some light


Cause I'm stuck with your stories


But no clue who you are


And no idea if you're dead or just too far


Somebody tell me, come and give me a sign


If I fight those monsters, is it you I'll find?


If so, then


Give me sirens and a cyclops


Give me giants and a hydra


I know life and fate are scary


But I wanna be legendary


I'll fight the harpies and chimeras


The minotaurs, even Cerberus


I know life and fate are scary


But I wanna be l-l-l-l-legendary


There are strangers in our halls


Trying to win the heart of my mom


But she is standing tall


108 old faces of men who call me small


They keep taking space and it's not much longer we can stall


Cause they're getting impatient, dangerous too


And I would fight them if I was half as strong as you


Somebody help me, come and give me the strength


Can I do whatever it takes to keep my mom safe?


If so, then


Give me sirens and a cyclops


Give me giants and a hydra


I know life and fate are scary


But I wanna be legendary


I'll fight the harpies and chimeras


The minotaurs, even Cerberus


I know life and fate are scary


But I wanna be legendary
