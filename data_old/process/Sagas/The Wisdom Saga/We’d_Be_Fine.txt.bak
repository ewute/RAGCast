We’d Be Fine

            [TELEMAHCUS]


I don't know who this friend is


Or if he's worth the hype but


My time with you has been splendid


The best day of my life


Cause I got in a fight, sailed to an island


When I've never left home shores


You're the friend I've never had before


And so I think maybe, if life wasn't spent as planned


Maybe, it's time that you lend a hand


I don't think he'll mind


If not his friend then mine
