Love in Paradise

            [CALYPSO]


Morning sleepyhead


You've been resting for a while


I swore that you were dead


When you washed up on my isle


Did you know you talk in your sleep?


Tell me, though, who's Penelope?


[ODYSSEUS]


She's my wife


[CALYPSO]


Anyways, I've got all you could want here


All you could need here


Just you and me, my dear my love for life


Soon into bed we'll climb and spend our time


[ODYSSEUS]


I'm not your man


[CALYPSO]


I'm what you want here


I'm what you need here


Just you and me, my love in paradise


Now til the end of time


From here on out, you're mine, all mine


[ODYSSEUS]


Hell no, I could kill you where you stand


I'm no pet, I'm a married man


[CALYPSO]


Oh handsome, you may try


But last I checked, goddesses can't die


[ODYSSEUS]


Goddess?


[CALYPSO]


You're adorable


Bow down now to the immortal Calypso, here to entertain


But fear not, I bring no pain


Cause we've got


All we could want here


All we could need here


Under my spell, we're stuck in paradise


No one can come nor go, my island stays unknown


[ODYSSEUS]


No, no


I don't belong here


There's something wrong here


I won't be drawn to love in paradise


Not till the end of time, there is no way


[CALYPSO]


You're mine, all mine
