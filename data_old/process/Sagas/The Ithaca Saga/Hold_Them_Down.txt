Hold Them Down

 [ANTINUOUS]

Screw this competition, we've been here for hours

None of us can string this, we don't?have?the power

Screw this?damn challenge, no more delays

Can't you?guys see we're being played?

This is how they

[ANTINUOUS, SUITORS]

Hold us down while the throne gets colder

Hold us down while we slowly age

Hold us down while the boy gets bolder

Where the hell is our pride and our rage?

Here and now, there's a chance for action

Here and now, we can take control

Here and now, burn it down to ashes

Channel the fire inside your soul

[ANTINUOUS, SUITORS]

Hold us down

While the throne gets colder

Hold us down

While we slowly age

Hold us down

While the boy gets bolder

Where the hell is our pride and our rage?

Here and now

There's a chance for action

Here and now

We can take control

Here and now

Burn it down to ashes

Channel the fire inside your soul

[ANTINUOUS]

Haven't you noticed who's missing?

Don't you know the prince is not around

I heard he's on a diplomatic mission

And I heard today he comes back to town, so

I say we gather near the beaches

I say we wait 'til he arrives

Then, when he docks his ship, we can breach it

Let us leave now, today we can strike and

[ANTINUOUS, SUITORS]

Hold him down 'til the boy stops shaking

Hold him down while I slit his throat

Hold him down while I slowly break his pride, his trust, his faith, and his bones

Cut him down into tiny pieces

Throw him down in the great below

When the crown wonders where the prince is

Only the ocean and I will know

[ANTINUOUS]

And when the deed is done

The queen will have no one to

Stop us from breaking her bedroom door

Stop us from taking her love and more

[ANTINUOUS, SUITORS]

And then we'll

Hold her down while her gate is open

Hold her down while I get a taste

Hold her down while we share her spoils

I will not let any part go to waste

Here and now, there's a chance for action

Here and now, we can take control

Here and now, burn it down to ashes

Channel the fire inside your soul and

Hold 'em down, hold 'em down

Hold 'em down, hold 'em down
