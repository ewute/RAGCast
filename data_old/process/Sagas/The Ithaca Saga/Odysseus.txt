Odysseus

 [SUITORS]

In the heat of battle at the edge of the unknown

Somewhere in the shadows lurks an agile deadly foe

We have the advantage, we've the numbers and the might

No, you don't understand it. This man plans for every fight

Where is he? Where is he?

Keep your head down, he's aiming for the torches

Our weapons, they're missing!

He's using the darkness to hide his approaches

We're empty handed up against an archer

Our only chance is to strike him in the darkness

We know these halls, the odds can be tilted

[ODYSSEUS]

You don't think I know my own palace?

I built it

[AMPHINOMUS]

Damn, he's more cunning than I assumed

While we were busy plotting, he hid our weapons inside this room
