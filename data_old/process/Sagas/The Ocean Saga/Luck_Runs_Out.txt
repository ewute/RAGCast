Luck Runs Out

 [EURYLOCHUS]

Please don't tell me you're about to do what I think you'll do

[ODYSSEUS]

You've heard the?legends?of the island?in the sky, this proves they're?true

We're in the home of the wind god

[EURYLOCHUS]

We don't know for sure

[ODYSSEUS]

How many floating islands have you seen before?

This is the home of the wind god

[EURYLOCHUS]

And what's your plan?

[ODYSSEUS]

I'm gonna climb to the top and ask 'em for a hand

[EURYLOCHUS]

You could be caught off guard and lose your life

Or piss off this god and infuse us with strife

Don't forget how dangerous the gods are

[ODYSSEUS]

Have faith, friend, we've come this far

[EURYLOCHUS, CREW]

Yes, but how much longer til your luck runs out?

How much longer 'til the show goes south?

How much longer 'til we all fall down?

You rely on wit, and people die on it, woah

[ODYSSEUS]

I still believe in goodness

I still believe that we could be kind

Lead from the heart, and see what starts

[EURYLOCHUS]

And what will we do when it tears us apart?

[ODYSSEUS]

Where is this coming from, my friend?

[EURYLOCHUS]

I just don't wanna see another life end

You're like the brother I could never do without

[ODYSSEUS]

And suddenly you doubt that I could figure this out?

[EURYLOCHUS, CREW]

Captain, how much longer til your luck runs out?

How much longer 'til the show goes south?

How much longer 'til we all fall down?

You rely on wit, and people die on it, woah

How much longer 'til the snake breaks free?

How much longer 'til your great days cease?

How much longer 'til your strength takes leave?

You rely on wit, and people die on it, woah

[ODYSSEUS]

Thank you for the concern but brother I can assure you

Our journey is almost done

I understand that we're tired

I understand that we're fazed

But don't forget how much we've already faced

I took six hundred men to war and not one of them died there

In case you needed a reminder

If you'd like to speak more, let me pull you aside then

I need to talk to you in private

I can't have you planting seeds of doubt

I can't have you disagreeing each route

I need you to always be devout and comply with this

Or we'll all die in this

Okay?

[EURYLOCHUS]

Okay

[ODYSSEUS]

Thank you
