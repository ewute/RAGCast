Keep Your Friends Close

 [ODYSSEUS]

Great wind god, Aeolus

I don't know if you know this

But our path to home is blocked by an impenetrable storm

I ask for your assistance

So we at last can go the distance

Can you cast the perfect winds for us and aid our journey home?

[AEOLUS]

Ha ha ha

I am the wind, twisting and turning

I give the fire enough to stay burning

Let's play a game

[ODYSSEUS]

A game?

[AEOLUS]

That's what I'm serving

And if you win, you will get what you're yearning

[ODYSSEUS]

Deal

[AEOLUS]

Take a look right here at this bag

It has the winds of the storm all trapped

All you gotta do is not open this bag

[ODYSSEUS]

Sounds too easy, what's the catch?

[AEOLUS, WINIONS]

Ha ha ha

Keep your friends close and your enemi?s closer

Never r?ally know who you can trust

If they wanna get the bag open, you gotta say "no, sir"

Sometimes killing is a must

[ODYSSEUS]

What?

[AEOLUS]

'Cause the end always justifies the means

Friends turn into foes and rivalries

So keep your friends close and your enemies closer

Never really know who you can trust (Never really know who you can trust)

[PERIMEDES]

Captain, what's happening?

[PERIMEDES, ELPENOR]

What's trapped in that bag?

[ODYSSEUS]

Something dangerous, friends

We mustn't lag

[WINIONS]

It's treasure!

[ODYSSEUS]

What?

[WINIONS]

Buh-bye!

[PERIMEDES]

Open the bag

[ELPENOR]

Let's see what you got

[ODYSSEUS]

No, do not

Everybody listen closely

See how this bag is closed?

That's how it's supposed to be

This bag has the storm inside

We cannot let the treasure rumor fly

[PERIMEDES, ELPENOR]

We'll try

[AEOLUS, CREW, WINIONS]

Keep your friends close and your enemies closer

Never really know who you can trust

Never really know who you can trust

Now they wanna get the bag open so they can have closure

Sometimes sneaking is a must

Sometimes sneaking is a must

'Cause the end always justifies the means

Everything's changed since Polites, so

Keep your friends close and your enemies closer

Never really know who you can trust

Never really know who you can trust

[ODYSSEUS]

For nine days, I've stayed wide awake

Trying to make it home with no storm or tidal wave

I remain unopposed, the bag is still closed

And I'm getting closer to you

[CREW]

Penelope

[ODYSSEUS]

I can't wait to make some new memories

[CREW]

Telemachus

[ODYSSEUS]

Time for me to be the father I never was

[PENELOPE, TELEMACHUS]

Just keep your eyes open

[ODYSSEUS]

Why are my eyes and my heart and my soul so heavy?

[PENELOPE, TELEMACHUS]

Just keep your eyes open

[ODYSSEUS]

I keep on trying to embrace you both

Why won't you let me?

[PENELOPE, TELEMACHUS]

Just keep your eyes open

[ODYSSEUS]

So much has changed but I'm the same

Yes I'm the same

[PENELOPE, TELEMACHUS]

Just keep your eyes open

[ENSEMBLE]

Just keep your eyes open

[PENELOPE]

Wake up!

Wake up, Odysseus, they're opening the bag

Wake up!

[ODYSSEUS]

No!

[AEOLUS, CREW, WINIONS]

Keep your friends close and your enemies closer

Never really know who you can trust

Never really know who you can trust

Storm

Full speed ahead

[ODYSSEUS]

Where's the storm taking us?

[AEOLUS]

I said to keep the bag closed, but you weren't compliant

If I had to guess? You're heading to the

[AEOLUS, WINIONS]

Land of the giants

[CREW]

Storm, storm

[ODYSSEUS]

Help me close the bag

[EURYLOCHUS]

But sir, it's too late

[ODYSSEUS]

We can save whatever wind is left to use another day

Come on!

[POSEIDON]

Odysseus of Ithaca

Do you know who I am?
