Ruthlessness

            [LAESTRYGONIANS]


Poseidon, Poseidon, Poseidon, Poseidon, Poseidon, Poseidon, Poseidon


[ODYSSEUS, spoken]


Poseidon


[POSEIDON]


In all my years of living


It isn't very often that I get pissed off


I try to chill with the waves


But damn, you crossed the line


I've been so gracious


And yet, you hurt the son of mine


That's right, the cyclops you made blind, is mine


[ODYSSEUS, spoken]


No


[POSEIDON, LAESTRYGONIANS]


I'm left without a choice


And without a doubt


Guess the pack of wolves is swimming with the shark now


I've gotta make you bleed


I need to see you drown


But before you go, I need to make you learn how


Ruthlessness is mercy upon ourselves


Ruthl?ssness is mercy upon ourselv?s


Ruthlessness is mercy upon ourselves


Ourselves


You are the worst kind of good


'Cause you're not even great


A Greek who reeks of false righteousness


That's what I hate


'Cause you fight to save lives


But won't kill and don't get the job done


I mean you totally could have avoided all this


Had you just killed my son


But no


You are far too nice


Mercy has a price


It's the final crack, we're about to break the ice now


You reveal your name


Then you let him live


Unlike you I've got no mercy left to give 'cause


Ruthlessness is mercy upon ourselves


Ruthlessness is mercy upon ourselves


Ruthlessness is mercy upon ourselves


Ourselves


And now it is finally time


To say goodbye


Today, you die


Unless, of course, you apologize


For my son's pain


And all his cries


[ODYSSEUS]


Poseidon, we meant no harm


We only hurt him to disarm him


We took no pleasure in his pain


We only wanted to escape


[POSEIDON]


The line between naïveté and


Hopefulness is almost invisible


So close your heart


The world is dark and


[LAESTRYGONIANS]


Ruthlessness is mercy-


[POSEIDON]


Die


[LAESTRYGONIANS, SOLDIERS]


Ruthlessness is (Captain) mercy upon our- Captain


Ruthlessness is (Captain) mercy upon our- Captain


Ruthlessness is (Captain) mercy upon our- Captain


Ruthlessness is (Captain)


[ODYSSEUS]


What have you done?


[ENSEMBLE]


When does a ripple become a tidal wave?


[POSEIDON]


Forty three left under your command


[ENSEMBLE]


When does a man become a monster?


[POSEIDON]


I am your darkest moment


The monster that always draws near


Any last words?


[ODYSSEUS]


All I gotta do is open this bag


[POSEIDON]


What?


Remember me
