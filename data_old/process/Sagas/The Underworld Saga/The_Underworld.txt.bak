The Underworld

            [ODYSSEUS]


Friends, Circe's instructions were clear


No matter what we hear


[SOLDIERS]


Full speed ahead


[ODYSSEUS]


Until we find the prophet


My comrades, this land confuses your mind


So no matter who we find


[SOLDIERS]


Full speed ahead, until we find the prophet


[ODYSSEUS, spoken]


Good


[ODYSSEUS, SOLDIERS]


All I hear are screams, every time I dare to close my eyes


I no longer dream, only nightmares of those who've died


Nothing's what it seems


Nothing's what it seems


And here in The Underworld, the past seems close behind


This land confuses your mind


[FALLEN SOLDIERS]


When does a man become a monster?


558 men who died under your command


Captain! Captain! Captain! Captain!


Why would you let the cyclops live


When ruthlessness is mercy?


[ODYSSEUS, SOLDIERS]


All I hear are screams, every time I dare to close my eyes


I no longer dream, only nightmares of those who've died


Nothing's what it seems


Nothing's what it seems


But in The Underworld, the past seems close behind


I keep thinking of the infant from that night


I keep thinking of the infant from that night
