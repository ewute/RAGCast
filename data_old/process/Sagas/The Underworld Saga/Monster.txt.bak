Monster

            [ODYSSEUS]


How has everything been turned against us?


How did suffering become so endless?


How am I to reunite with my estranged?


Do I need to change?


I'm surrounded by the souls of those I've lost


I'm the only whose line I haven't crossed


What if the greatest threat we'll find across the sea


Is me?


What if I'm the monster?


What if I'm in the wrong?


What if I'm the problem that's been hiding all along?


What if I'm the one who killed you


Every time I caved to guilt?


What if I've been far too kind to foes


But a monster to ourselves?


What if I'm the monster


Is the cyclops struck with guilt when he kills?


Is he up in the middle of the night?


Or does he end my men to avenge his friend


And then sleep knowing he has done him right?


When the witch turns men to pigs to protect her nymphs


Is she going insane?


Or did she learn to be colder when she got older and now she saves them the pain?


When a god comes down and makes a fleet drown


Is he scared that he's doing something wrong?


Or does he keep us in check so we must respect him


And now no one dares to piss him off?


Does a soldier use a wooden horse to kill sleeping Trojans cause he is vile?


Or does he throw away his remorse and save more lives with guile


If I became the monster, and threw that guilt away


Would that make us stronger?


Would it keep our foes at bay?


If I became the monster to everyone but us


And made sure we got home again


Who would care if we're unjust


If I became the


[SOLDIERS]


Monster


[ODYSSEUS]


Oh, ruthlessness is mercy upon ourselves


[SOLDIERS]


Monster


[ODYSSEUS]


And deep down I know this well


I lost my best friend


I lost my mentor, my mom


500 men gone, this can't go on


I must get to see Penelope and Telemachus


So if we must sail through dangerous oceans and beaches


I'll go where Poseidon won't reach us


And if I gotta drop another infant from a wall


In an instant so we all don't die


[ODYSSEUS, ALL]


Then I'll become the


Monster


I will deal the blow


And I'll become the


Monster


Like none they've ever known


So what if I'm the


Monster


Lurking deep below


I must become the


Monster


And then we'll make it home
