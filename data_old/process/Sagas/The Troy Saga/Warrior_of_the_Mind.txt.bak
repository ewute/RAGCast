Warrior of the Mind

            [ATHENA]


Have you forgotten the lessons I taught you?


[ODYSSEUS]


Athena!


[ATHENA]


Have you forgotten to turn off your heart? This is not you


I see you changing from how I've designed you


Have you forgotten your purpose? Let me remind you


Goddess of wisdom, master of war


My life has one mission, create the greatest warrior


I had a challenge, a test of skill


A magic boar only the best could kill


One day a boy came for the thrill


A boy whose mind rivalled the boar's own will


[ODYSSEUS]


Let's go!


[ATHENA]


Maybe one day he'll follow me


And w?'ll make a greater tomorrow, th?n they'll see


I know he'll change the world


'Cause he is a warrior of the mind


Maybe one day I'll reach him


And we can build his skills as I teach him


If there's a problem, he'll have the answer


He is a warrior of the mind


[ODYSSEUS]


Show yourself


I know you're watching me


Show yourself


I can see you


[ATHENA]


How can you see through my spell?


[ODYSSEUS, spoken]


Haha! I was lying and you fell for my bluff


Hahahaha


[ATHENA]


Well done, enlighten me, what's your name?


[ODYSSEUS]


You first, and maybe I'll do the same


[ATHENA]


Nice try, but two can play this game


[ODYSSEUS, ENSEMBLE]


Nah, don't be modest


I know you're a goddess


So let's be honest


You are Athena (Athena)


Badass in the arena


Unmatched, witty, and queen of


The best strategies we've seen


[ATHENA]


If you're looking for a mentor, I'll make sure your time's well spent


[ODYSSEUS]


Sounds like a plan


Goddess and man


Bestest of friends


[ATHENA]


We'll see where it ends


[ODYSSEUS]


Okay


[ATHENA]


Maybe one day they'll follow me and we'll


[BOTH]


Make a greater tomorrow, then they'll see


I know we'll change the world


'Cause we are the warriors of the mind


Maybe one day we'll reach them


And we can build their skills as we teach them


If there's a problem, we'll have the answer


We are the warriors of the mind


[ATHENA]


I still intend to make sure you don't fall behind


Don't forget that you're a warrior of a very special kind


You are a warrior of the mind


Don't disappoint me
