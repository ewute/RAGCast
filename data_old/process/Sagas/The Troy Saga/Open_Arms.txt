Open Arms

 [POLITES]

You can relax, my friend

[ODYSSEUS]

Huh?

[POLITES]

I can tell you're getting nervous

So do yourself a service

And try to relax my friend

[ODYSSEUS]

I'm fine, Polites

[POLITES]

Think of all that we have been through

We'll survive what we get into

I know that you're tired of the war and bloodshed

Tell me, is this how we're supposed to live?

Look at how you grip your sword, enough said

Why should we take when we could give?

You could show a person that you trust them

When you stop and lower your guard

Here we have a chance for some adjustment

Give it a try, it's not that hard

I'm telling you

This life is amazing when you greet it with open arms

Whatever we face, we'll be fine if we're leading from the heart

No matter the place, we can light up the world

Here's how to start:

Greet the world with open arms

Greet the world with open arms

[LOTUS EATERS]

Welcome

[ODYSSEUS]

Stay back

[LOTUS EATERS]

Stay back

[POLITES]

My friend, greet the world with open arms

[ODYSSEUS]

We're only here for food

[LOTUS EATERS]

Food

[ODYSSEUS]

Six hundred friends are waiting for us to show our faces

[LOTUS EATERS]

Food

[ODYSSEUS]

Stay back, I'm warning you

[LOTUS EATERS]

Food (Num num num)

[ODYSSEUS]

If we don't get back safely, my men will turn this place into blazes

[LOTUS EATERS]

Here you go

[POLITES]

See? This life is amazing when you greet it with open arms

Whatever we face, we'll be fine if we're leading from the heart

No matter the place, we can light up the world

Here's how to start:

Greet the world with open arms

Greet the world with open arms

[ODYSSEUS]

My friend, I wish that I could say that I agree

But look at the way this fruit is glowing and filled with glowing seeds

It took me a while to notice just what kind of fruit they eat

It's a lotus, it controls your mind and never lets you free

That's what we'd get with open arms

[POLITES]

Lotus eaters, I'd like to show my friend that kindness is brave

Could you tell me where there's other food to eat?

[LOTUS EATERS]

The cave (Scary cave)

[POLITES]

A cave! You're saying there's a cave where we could feast?

And where do we sail to find this food-filled cave?

[LOTUS EATERS]

East (That way)

[POLITES]

Thank you!

[LOTUS EATERS]

Welcome

[POLITES]

This life is amazing when you greet it with open arms

I see in your face, there is so much guilt inside your heart

So why not replace it and light up the world

Here's how to start:

Greet the world with open arms

Greet the world with open arms

[ODYSSEUS]

Greet the world with open arms

[POLITES]

You can relax, my friend
