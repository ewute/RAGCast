Different Beast

 [ODYSSEUS]

Let's cut this charade, you are no wife of mine

You've been tryna take my life this whole time

I know underwater, there are packs of you hiding

Yeah, I know exactly what you are: a siren

My real wife knows I'm not scared of the water

And my real wife knows I don't have a daughter

But while you were so focused on turning my men into snacks

You didn't notice that your friends got snatched

[SIREN]

What?

[ODYSSEUS, SOLDIERS]

We are a different beast now

We ar? the ones who feast now

No mor? of us decease, 'cause we won't take more suffering from you

We are the man-made monsters

We are the ones who conquer

You are a threat no longer

We won't take more suffering from you

[ODYSSEUS]

We've been away from home for about 12 years or so

First we slayed in our own war

And now, we're here with more foes

While on the run from Poseidon

We found a ship with no crew

I realised nearby, there were sirens

Singing sailors to their dooms

We filled our ears with beeswax

That's how we resist your song

You pretended to be my wife, so I just played along

I read your lips and phrases

Scanning for information

Sirens know about every route and horizon

Now I know how to get back to my island

[SOLDIERS]

We are a different beast now

We are the ones who feast now

No more of us decease, 'cause we won't take more suffering from you

We are the man-made monsters

We are the ones who conquer

You are a threat no longer

We won't take more suffering from you

[SIRENS]

Spare us

Oh, spare us please

[ODYSSEUS]

Why?

So you can kill the next group of sailors in this part of the sea?

Nah, you wouldn't have spared me

I made a mistake like this and almost cost my life

I can't take more risks of not seeing my wife

Cut off their tails! We're ending this now

Throw their bodies back in the water

Let them drown

[SIRENS]

No!

[SOLDIERS]

He is a different beast now

He is the one who feasts now

No more of us deceased, 'cause he won't take more suffering from you

He is the man-made monster

He is the one who conquers

You are a threat no longer

He won't take more suffering from you

[ODYSSEUS]

Kill them all!

[SOLDIERS]

Oh, woah-oh-oh, oh woah-oh-oh, oh, woah-oh-oh

[ODYSSEUS]

Kill them all!

[SOLDIERS]

Oh, woah-oh-oh, oh woah-oh-oh, oh, woah-oh-oh

[ODYSSEUS]

Kill them all!

[SOLDIERS]

Oh, woah-oh-oh, oh woah-oh-oh, oh, woah-oh-oh

[ODYSSEUS]

Kill 'em all!

[SOLDIERS]

Oh, woah-oh-oh, oh woah-oh-oh, oh, woah-oh-oh
