Scylla

 [SCYLLA]

Deep down, we're lonely demons from hell

[ODYSSEUS]

Row for your lives!

[SCYLLA]

Drown in your sorrow and fears

Choke on your blood and your tears

Bleed til you've run out of years

We must do what it takes to survive

Give up your honor and faith

Live up your life as a wraith

Die in the blood where you bathe

We must do it takes to survive
