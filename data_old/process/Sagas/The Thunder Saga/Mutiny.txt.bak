Mutiny

            [EURYLOCHUS & SOLDIERS]


How much longer must we suffer now?


How much longer must we push through doubt?


How much longer must we go about


Our lives like this when people die like this?


Woah


[EURYLOCHUS]


When we fought the cyclops, you were quick to hatch a plan


And when we fought with Circe, it was you who left behind no man


But when we fought this monster, we didn't take a stand


We just ran


Say something


[ODYSSEUS]


I can't


[EURYLOCHUS]


Then you have forced my hand


[ODYSSEUS]


Lower your weapon


[EURYLOCHUS]


No can do


You miss your wife so bad you trade the lives of your own crew


[ODYSSEUS]


Don't make m? fight you, brother, you know you'd have done th? same


[EURYLOCHUS]


If you want all the power, you must carry all the blame


[SOLDIERS]


Eurylochus, Eurylochus, Eurylochus


Odysseus, Odysseus, Odysseus


There is no price he won't pay


[ODYSSEUS]


I am not letting you get in my way
