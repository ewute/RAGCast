Suffering

            [ENSEMBLE, SIRENS]


Penelope (Ah, oh)


Penelope (Ah, oh)


[PENELOPE]


Don’t you miss me?


[ODYSSEUS]


More than you know


[PENELOPE]


Then jump in the water and kiss me


[ODYSSEUS]


Penelope, I’ve told you this before


You know I’m afraid of the water


[PENELOPE]


I’ll make sure that you are safe and sound


Come play with me and our daughter and let’s watch our love leave the ground


[ODYSSEUS]


Oh, I would


But I’d be suffering trying to float the whole time


[PENELOPE]


I would take the suffering from you


[ODYSSEUS]


Oh, as good as it sounds, right here I’m just fin?


[PENELOPE]


I could take the suffering from you


[ODYSSEUS]


You know that I pr?fer my feet on the ground


[PENELOPE]


I will take the suffering from you


[ODYSSEUS]


Fine, but only if you answer a question or two


[PENELOPE]


Of course!


[ODYSSEUS]


Okay, so let’s say I was on the run or hiding…


From I don’t know Poseidon…


And let’s say he blocked the way home with giant waves and giant storms


[PENELOPE]


Oh no!


[ODYSSEUS]


How am I to evade him?


How am I to get home?


Which route should I take?


Where am I supposed to go?


[PENELOPE]


He will chase you high and low


So find a place he’d never go


The one way you'll get home


Is sailing where he's scared to roam, oh


It’s through the lair of Scylla


[ODYSSEUS]


No...


[PENELOPE]


This is your only way home


The lair of Scylla


[ODYSSEUS]


But Scylla has a cost


[PENELOPE]


Well, you asked and now you know


Now jump in the water!


[ODYSSEUS]


Penelope, why?


You know I’m too shy and terrified


[PENELOPE]


I would take the suffering from you


[ODYSSEUS]


Oh, for you, I would die, but can't you let me stay dry?


[PENELOPE]


I could take the suffering from you


[ODYSSEUS]


You should come onto the ship


We'll jump at the same time


[PENELOPE]


I will take the suffering from you


[ODYSSEUS]


Ah, the things I do for you
