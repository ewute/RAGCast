Thunder Bringer

            [ZEUS]


Pride is a damsel in distress


Hiding away where only I can undress her


Try all she can not to confess


In the end, it's all the same once I apply all the pressure


Thunder, bring her through the wringer


Show her I'm the judgment call


The one who makes her kingdom fall


Lightning, wield her, use and yield her


Show her what she can't conceal


For true nature will be revealed


Tell me, Odysseus, If I were to make you choose


The lives of your men and crew or your own


Why do I think they'd lose?


Enlighten me, King of Ithaca


Since hunger was far too great


I wonder who'd take the weight of the damned


And suffer a gruesome fate to the


Thunder Bringer, here to ring your


Ears until your deaf with fear and


Spear you while your death is near


Lighting wielder, here to yield your


Time for you have passed your prime


Sublime you for your act of crime
