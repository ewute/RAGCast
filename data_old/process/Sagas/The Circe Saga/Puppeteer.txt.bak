Puppeteer

            [EURYLOCHUS]


Captain, I have something that I must confess


Something that I must get off my chest


Until it is said, I cannot rest


Captain?


[ODYSSEUS]


Eurylochus, go make sure this island is secure


[EURYLOCHUS]


But captai


[ODYSSEUS]


There's only so much left we can endure


Whatever you need to say can wait some more


Of that, I'm sure


[EURYLOCHUS]


Okay


[EURYLOCHUS]


Sir, since we left home we've faced a variety of foes from a wide range of places


Gods, monsters, you know the roster, hostile creatures that we could resist


But this was a h?ll of a twist, cause we are w?ak to a power like this


[ODYSSEUS, spoken]


What was it?


[EURYLOCHUS, spoken]


A woman


[ODYSSEUS, spoken]


What?


[EURYLOCHUS, spoken]


She had us in just two words


[CIRCE]


Come inside


[ODYSSEUS, spoken]


Damn


[CIRCE]


Welcome to the best part of your lives


Go ahead and rest wherever you like


I got you, don't worry Circe's got you now


[EURYLOCHUS, spoken]


Only I stayed outside, but the rest went in


[CIRCE]


Take a seat


Let me bring you all something to eat


I bet you're tired from the years spent on your feet


I got you, don't worry Circe's got you now


[EURYLOCHUS, spoken]


By the time they ate, it was far too late


[EURYLOCHUS, CIRCE]


For inside the meal, think of your past


She had cast a spell, and your mistakes


They began to squeal, they'll be the last


And grow snouts and tails, mistakes you'll make


She changed them


[CIRCE]


I got all the power, yeah, I got all the power


No, I'm not a player, I'm a puppeteer


No, I don't play, I puppeteer, yeah


[EURYLOCHUS, CIRCE]


They transformed, this is the price


And it wasn't quick, we pay to live


She turned our men, the world does not


From men to pigs, tend to forgive


She changed them


[CIRCE]


I got all the power, yeah, I got all the power


No, I'm not a player, I'm a puppeteer


No, I don't play, I puppeteer, yeah


[ODYSSEUS, spoken]


We have to go save them


[EURYLOCHUS]


No we don't


Look at all we've lost and all we've learned


Every single cost is so much more than what we've earned


Think about the men we have left before there's none


Let's just cut our losses, you and I, and let's run


[ODYSSEUS]


Of course I'd like to leave now, of course I'd like to run


But I can hardly sleep now knowing everything we've done


There's no length I wouldn't go if it was you I had to save


I can only hope you'd do the same
