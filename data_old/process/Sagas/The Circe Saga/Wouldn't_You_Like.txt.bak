Wouldn't You Like

            [HERMES giggles]


[HERMES]


I must say, what a brilliant speech you gave


[ODYSSEUS, spoken]


Who goes there?


[HERMES]


Just a friend who could help you save your men


A foe like Circe's not to be messed with


You want to beat her?


You'll need the blessing of a certain god


Divine intervention


Someone who's not afraid to send a message


[ODYSSEUS, spoken]


Hermes?


[HERMES laughs]


[HERMES]


Wouldn't you like a taste of the power?


Wouldn't you like to use more than words?


Deep in the night, the fight lasts for hours


You can be hurt or you can beat her


Wouldn't you like to hav? some of the magic?


Wouldn't you like your outcom? preferred?


Deep in the night, the fight can be tragic


I'll help you conquer her


She can turn you to an animal


That'll end up on her plate


She can all but make you fall in love


Like you're on your hundredth date


She can conjure up a monster


That'll grind you to the bones


She has all the ways to haunt ya


When you take her on alone


[HERMES & ENSEMBLE]


Wouldn't you like a taste of the power?


Wouldn't you like to use more than words?


Deep in the night, the fight lasts for hours


You can be hurt or you can beat her


Wouldn't you like to have some of the magic?


Wouldn't you like your outcome preferred?


Deep in the night, the fight can be tragic


I'll help you conquer her


[HERMES]


Oh-oh


Here in the root of this flower


There lies such a power to take her on


You must consume and digest it


Then you'll manifest a being of your creation


All you need's imagination


Though it's only for a moment


Till you've beaten your opponent


[HERMES, spoken]


And I call this root "holy moly"


[ODYSSEUS, spoken]


Ah


[HERMES laughs]


[HERMES & ENSEMBLE]


Wouldn't you like a taste of the power?


Wouldn't you like to use more than words?


Deep in the night, the fight lasts for hours


You can be hurt or you can beat her


Wouldn't you like to have some of the magic?


Wouldn't you like your outcome preferred?


Deep in the night, the fight can be tragic


I'll help you conquer her


[HERMES & ENSEMBLE, ODYSSEUS]


(Oh) Wouldn't you like a taste of the power?


Wouldn't you like to use more than words?


(Oh) Deep in the night, the fight lasts for hours


You can be hurt or you can beat her


(Oh) Wouldn't you like to have some of the magic?


Wouldn't you like your outcome preferred?


(Oh) Deep in the night, the fight can be tragic


I'll help you conquer her


[ODYSSEUS, spoken]


Hermes, thank you


[HERMES]


Don't thank me, friend, you very well may die


Mh-hm-hm, good luck
