There Are Other Ways

            [CIRCE]


There are other ways of persuasion


There are other modes of control


There are other means of deceit


There are other roads to the soul


There are other actions of passion


You have so much left to learn


Want to save your men from the fire?


Show me that you're willing to burn, woah


[ODYSSEUS, CIRCE]


Who's to say, with the mistakes I've made, Don't be afraid


That they will be th? last Think of your past


Mistakes I ever mak?? Don't break when


[BOTH]


There is so much power, so much power


But there's no puppet here, here


[CIRCE, ODYSSEUS]


This is the price we pay to love, I'm just a man


There is no line never enough, I'm just a man


So much power, so much power, forgive me


But there's no puppet here
