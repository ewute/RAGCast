The Circe Saga,Done For,Circe,"Who, me?

All I did was reveal their true forms

Huh

I don't know who you are nor why you're here

But let me make this one thing clear

I've got people to protect

Nymphs I can't n?glect

So I'm not taking chances, dear

If you mak? one wrong move, then you're done for

Anything I don't approve, then you're done for

I could put a spell on you and you're done for

Boy, you better run or soon you will done for

You must be a liar

Mortals can't acquire

Moly without dire consequence

Hermes gave it to you, didn't he?

I've got people to protect, friends I can't neglect

So now there is no turning back

You've made your one wrong move, now you're done for

I will be the one to prove that you're done for

Not even a spell saves you, cause you're done for

Oh, you better run or soon you will be done for

My nymphs are like my daughters

I protect them at all costs

The last time we let strangers live

We faced a heavy loss

You've given me no reason to

Bestow you with my trust

But everyone's true colours are

Revealed in acts of lust"
The Cyclops Saga,My Goodbye,Athena,"You were reckless, sentimental at best

That's not a teaching of mine

You’ve grown soft, your dead friends can attest

Hey!

Put your emotions aside

You're a warrior meant to lead the rest

I don't know where I went wrong

But I warned ya’, and you failed the test

So now I'm gone

This way, you'll know what your place is

This way, you can't cross the line

This way, when all is over you'll keep yours and I'll keep mine

This way, you won't disappoint me

This way, you won't waste my time

This way, I’ll close the door

Consider this as my goodbye

You're not looking for a mentor

I'm not looking for a friend

I mistook you for a general

What a waste of effort spent

One day, you'll hear what I'm saying

One day, you might understand

One day, but not today, for after all you're

This day, you sever your own head

This day, you cut the line

This day, you lost it all

Consider this as my goodbye

Ohh

Consider this as my goodbye

Ohh

This is my goodbye

Ohh

Consider this as my goodbye

Ohh

This is my goodbye"

That’s just lik? you, why should I be surprised?

Selfish and prid?ful and vain

Unlike you, every time someone dies

I'm left to deal with the strain

What’s a title that a goddess could lend if I'll never sleep at night?

I'll remind you I saw you as a friend

But now we're done

This way, you’re out of my head now

This way, you won't plague my life

This way, when all is done, you're out of sight and out of mind

This way, you get what you wanted

This way, you can save your time

This way, you close the door and have your damn goodbye

At least I know what I'm fighting for

While you're fighting to be known

Since you claim you're so much wiser

Why's your life spent all alone?

You're alone"
The Cyclops Saga,Polyphemus,Polyphemus,"Who are you?

You killed my sheep

My favourit? sheep

What gives you the right to deal a pain so deep

Don't you know that pain you sow is pain you r?ap?

Time to drink

Your blood over where you stand

Your life now is in my hand

Before I'm done

You will learn that it's not so fun to take

You came to my home to steal

But now you'll become my meal

A trade, you see?

Take from you like you took from me

Wine?

Ah, I'd like to thank you

Stranger, what's your name?

Nobody, for your gift I've one to reply

Yes, you shall be the final man to die"
The Ithaca Saga,Hold Them Down,Suitors,"Hold us down while the throne gets colder

Hold us down while we slowly age

Here and now

Burn it down to ashes

Channel the fire inside your soul

Hold him down 'til the boy stops shaking

Hold him down while I slit his throat

Hold him down while I slowly break his pride, his trust, his faith, and his bones

Cut him down into tiny pieces

Throw him down in the great below

When the crown wonders where the prince is

Only the ocean and I will know

And then we'll

Hold her down while her gate is open

Hold her down while I get a taste

Hold her down while we share her spoils

I will not let any part go to waste

The Ithaca Saga,Would You Fall In Love With Me Again,Odysseus,"Penelope

(opens the door of the bedroom)

I am not the man you fell in love with

I am not the man you once adored

I am not your kind and gentle husband

And I am not the love you knew before

Would you fall in love with me again

If you knew all I've done?

The things I cannot change

Would you love me all the same?

I know that you've been waiting, waiting for love

Left a trail of red on every island

As I traded friends like objects, I could use

Hurt more lives than I can count on my hands

But all of that was to bring me back to you

So tell me

Would you fall in love with me again

If you knew all I've done?

The things I can't undo

I am not the man you knew

I know that you've been waiting, waiting

How could you say this?

I had built that wedding bed with my blood and sweat

Carved it into the olive tree where we first met

A symbol of our love everlasting

Do you realize what you have asked me?

The only way to move it is to cut it from its roots

Penelope

Penelope

Waiting, waiting (Penelope)

Waiting, waiting

Waiting, oh

For you

Twenty years

I love you"

Do you know who I am?"
The Ocean Saga,Storm,Odysseus,"These waves and tides

There's no time to die

Comrades?

Brace for a storm

The Ocean Saga,Storm,Eurylochus,"Captain, we will capsize with thes? waves, our fleet will fail

We're taking too much damage to survive

At this rate, we won't make it out alive

What do you have in mind?

What?"
The Thunder Saga,Different Beast,Odysseus,"Let's cut this charade, you are no wife of mine

You've been tryna take my life this whole time

I know underwater, there are packs of you hiding

Yeah, I know exactly what you are: a siren

My real wife knows I'm not scared of the water

And my real wife knows I don't have a daughter

But while you were so focused on turning my men into snacks

You didn't notice that your friends got snatched

We are a different beast now

We ar? the ones who feast now

No mor? of us decease, 'cause we won't take more suffering from you

We are the man-made monsters

We are the ones who conquer

You are a threat no longer

We won't take more suffering from you

We've been away from home for about 12 years or so

First we slayed in our own war

And now, we're here with more foes

While on the run from Poseidon

We found a ship with no crew

I realised nearby, there were sirens

Singing sailors to their dooms

We filled our ears with beeswax

That's how we resist your song

You pretended to be my wife, so I just played along

I read your lips and phrases

Scanning for information

Sirens know about every route and horizon

Now I know how to get back to my island

Why?

So you can kill the next group of sailors in this part of the sea?

Nah, you wouldn't have spared me

I made a mistake like this and almost cost my life

I can't take more risks of not seeing my wife

Cut off their tails! We're ending this now

Throw their bodies back in the water

Let them drown

Kill them all!

Kill them all!

Kill them all!

Kill 'em all!"
The Thunder Saga,Suffering,Odysseus,"More than you know

Penelope, I’ve told you this before

You know I’m afraid of the water

Oh, I would

But I’d be suffering trying to float the whole time

Oh, as good as it sounds, right here I’m just fin?

You know that I pr?fer my feet on the ground

Fine, but only if you answer a question or two

Okay, so let’s say I was on the run or hiding…

From I don’t know Poseidon…

And let’s say he blocked the way home with giant waves and giant storms

How am I to evade him?

How am I to get home?

Which route should I take?

Where am I supposed to go?

No...

But Scylla has a cost

Penelope, why?

You know I’m too shy and terrified

Oh, for you, I would die, but can't you let me stay dry?

You should come onto the ship

We'll jump at the same time

Ah, the things I do for you"

Is he up in the middle of the night?

Or does he end my men to avenge his friend

And then sleep knowing he has done him right?

When the witch turns men to pigs to protect her nymphs

Is she going insane?

Or did she learn to be colder when she got older and now she saves them the pain?
