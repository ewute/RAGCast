The Thunder Saga,Suffering,odysseus,How am I to get home?
The Thunder Saga,Suffering,odysseus,Which route should I take?

The Thunder Saga,Suffering,penelope,This is your only way home
The Thunder Saga,Suffering,penelope,The lair of Scylla
The Thunder Saga,Suffering,odysseus,But Scylla has a cost

The Thunder Saga,Suffering,odysseus,You know I’m too shy and terrified
The Thunder Saga,Suffering,penelope,I would take the suffering from you
The Thunder Saga,Suffering,odysseus,"Oh, for you, I would die, but can't you let me stay dry?"
The Thunder Saga,Suffering,penelope,I could take the suffering from you
The Thunder Saga,Suffering,odysseus,You should come onto the ship
The Thunder Saga,Suffering,odysseus,We'll jump at the same time
The Thunder Saga,Suffering,penelope,I will take the suffering from you
The Thunder Saga,Suffering,odysseus,"Ah, the things I do for you"

The Thunder Saga,Different Beast,odysseus,My real wife knows I'm not scared of the water
The Thunder Saga,Different Beast,odysseus,And my real wife knows I don't have a daughter
The Thunder Saga,Different Beast,odysseus,But while you were so focused on turning my men into snacks
