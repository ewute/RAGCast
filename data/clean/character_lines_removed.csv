But there's no puppet here, here"
The Circe Saga,Wouldn't You Like,Hermes,"I must say, what a brilliant speech you gave

Just a friend who could help you save your men

A foe like Circe's not to be messed with

You want to beat her?

You'll need the blessing of a certain god

Divine intervention

Someone who's not afraid to send a message

Wouldn't you like a taste of the power?

Wouldn't you like to use more than words?

Deep in the night, the fight lasts for hours

You can be hurt or you can beat her

Wouldn't you like to hav? some of the magic?

Wouldn't you like your outcom? preferred?

Deep in the night, the fight can be tragic

I'll help you conquer her

She can turn you to an animal

That'll end up on her plate

She can all but make you fall in love

Like you're on your hundredth date

She can conjure up a monster

That'll grind you to the bones

She has all the ways to haunt ya

When you take her on alone

Wouldn't you like a taste of the power?

Wouldn't you like to use more than words?

Deep in the night, the fight lasts for hours

You can be hurt or you can beat her

Wouldn't you like to have some of the magic?

Wouldn't you like your outcome preferred?

Deep in the night, the fight can be tragic

I'll help you conquer her

Oh-oh

Here in the root of this flower

There lies such a power to take her on

You must consume and digest it

Then you'll manifest a being of your creation

All you need's imagination

Though it's only for a moment

Till you've beaten your opponent

And I call this root ""holy moly""

Wouldn't you like a taste of the power?

Wouldn't you like to use more than words?

Deep in the night, the fight lasts for hours

You can be hurt or you can beat her

Wouldn't you like to have some of the magic?

Wouldn't you like your outcome preferred?

Deep in the night, the fight can be tragic

I'll help you conquer her

(Oh) Wouldn't you like a taste of the power?

Wouldn't you like to use more than words?

(Oh) Deep in the night, the fight lasts for hours

You can be hurt or you can beat her

(Oh) Wouldn't you like to have some of the magic?

Wouldn't you like your outcome preferred?

(Oh) Deep in the night, the fight can be tragic

I'll help you conquer her

Hold us down while the throne gets colder

Hold us down while we slowly age

Hold us down while the boy gets bolder

Where the hell is our pride and our rage?

Here and now, there's a chance for action

Here and now, we can take control

Burn it down to ashes

Channel the fire inside your soul

Haven't you noticed who's missing?

Don't you know the prince is not around

I heard he's on a diplomatic mission

And I heard today he comes back to town, so

I say we gather near the beaches

I say we wait 'til he arrives

Then, when he docks his ship, we can breach it

Let us leave now, today we can strike and

Hold him down 'til the boy stops shaking

Hold him down while I slit his throat

Hold him down while I slowly break his pride, his trust, his faith, and his bones

Cut him down into tiny pieces

Throw him down in the great below

When the crown wonders where the prince is

Only the ocean and I will know

And when the deed is done

The queen will have no one to

Stop us from breaking her bedroom door

Stop us from taking her love and more

And then we'll

Hold her down while her gate is open

Hold her down while I get a taste

Hold her down while we share her spoils

I will not let any part go to waste

Here and now, there's a chance for action

Here and now, we can take control

Here and now, burn it down to ashes

Channel the fire inside your soul and

Hold 'em down, hold 'em down

Hold 'em down, hold 'em down"

I need to see you drown

Ruthlessness is mercy upon ourselves

Ruthl?ssness is mercy upon ourselv?s

Ruthlessness is mercy upon ourselves

Ourselves

You are the worst kind of good

'Cause you're not even great

A Greek who reeks of false righteousness

That's what I hate

'Cause you fight to save lives

But won't kill and don't get the job done

I mean you totally could have avoided all this

Had you just killed my son

But no

You are far too nice

Mercy has a price

It's the final crack, we're about to break the ice now

You reveal your name

Then you let him live

Unlike you I've got no mercy left to give 'cause

Ruthlessness is mercy upon ourselves

Ruthlessness is mercy upon ourselves

Ruthlessness is mercy upon ourselves

Ourselves

And now it is finally time

To say goodbye

Today, you die

Unless, of course, you apologize

For my son's pain

And all his cries

Ruthlessness is mercy-

Ruthlessness is (Captain) mercy upon our- Captain

Ruthlessness is (Captain) mercy upon our- Captain

Ruthlessness is (Captain) mercy upon our- Captain

They said they're taking you away

That you're not mine to save

So I came by to say

You're unlike anyone I have ever?known

'Cause?you're?all I've ever?known

And if I?pushed you

Or if I came on too strong

Or if I ambushed you

For that, I'll say I was wrong

And if you hate me

Then I am sorry my love's too much for you

But I'm not sorry for loving you

I'm not sorry for loving you

I'm not sorry for loving you

I'm not sorry for loving you

Let me speak

I spent my whole life here

Was cast away when I was young

Alone for a hundred years

I had no friends but the sky and sun

So when you washed ashore

I thought for sure that you were my dream come true

I thought I knew

So if I pushed you

Or if I came on too strong

Or if I ambushed you

For that, I'll say I was wrong

And if you hate me

Then I am sorry my love's too much for you

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

But I'm not sorry for loving you

I'm not sorry for loving you

I'm not sorry for loving you

I'm not sorry for loving you

I'm not sorry

I'm angry and tired and restless and sad

I'm stuck in the moments I swore that we had

I wish you would chase me

Or try to embrace me

For once, I wish you would lie and say

You do?

I hate that I fell in love with you

Hate that I fell in love with you

Why did I fall in love with you?

Why did I fall in love with you?

What do I do with this love for you?

What do I do with this love for you?

How am I supposed to get over you?

How am I supposed to get over you?

Bow down now to the immortal Calypso, here to entertain

But fear not, I bring no pain

Cause we've got

All we could want here

All we could need here

Cause I got in a fight, sailed to an island

When I've never left home shores

Maybe, it's time that you lend a hand

I don't think he'll mind

If not his friend then mine"
