The Circe Saga,Done For,Odysseus,"Lady of the palace, sorry that I ask this

But I hope that I've been misinformed

I sent out some scouts to take a look around through

Here and they wound up at your door

Through the years we seldom

Get a warm welcome, so

I must ask just to be sure

Did you do something to them?

You turned them into pigs

I don't mean to tip your scale but

You will fail at

Placing any spells on me

I just ate a flower

One that claims your power

So you better cower now and flee

Then I must be a god like you

Cause I got this root from the ground with my bare hands

Okay, fine, yes, but regardless

You and I are now evenly matched

Our fates are intertwined, they're attached

I've got people to protect, friends I can't neglect

So now there is no turning back

You've made your one wrong move, now you're done for

I will be the one to prove that you're done for

Not even a spell saves you, cause you're done for

Oh, you better run or soon you will be done for

You've lost

I'm not sure I follow"
The Circe Saga,Puppeteer,Eurylochus,"Captain, I have something that I must confess

Something that I must get off my chest

Until it is said, I cannot rest

Captain?

But captai

Okay

Sir, since we left home we've faced a variety of foes from a wide range of places

Gods, monsters, you know the roster, hostile creatures that we could resist

But this was a h?ll of a twist, cause we are w?ak to a power like this

A woman

She had us in just two words

Only I stayed outside, but the rest went in

By the time they ate, it was far too late

For inside the meal, think of your past

She had cast a spell, and your mistakes

They began to squeal, they'll be the last

And grow snouts and tails, mistakes you'll make

She changed them

They transformed, this is the price

And it wasn't quick, we pay to live

She turned our men, the world does not

From men to pigs, tend to forgive

She changed them

No we don't

Look at all we've lost and all we've learned

Every single cost is so much more than what we've earned

Think about the men we have left before there's none

Let's just cut our losses, you and I, and let's run"
The Circe Saga,Puppeteer,Odysseus,"Eurylochus, go make sure this island is secure

There's only so much left we can endure

Whatever you need to say can wait some more

Of that, I'm sure

What was it?

What?

Damn

We have to go save them

Of course I'd like to leave now, of course I'd like to run

But I can hardly sleep now knowing everything we've done

There's no length I wouldn't go if it was you I had to save

I can only hope you'd do the same"
The Circe Saga,Puppeteer,Circe,"Come inside

Welcome to the best part of your lives

Go ahead and rest wherever you like

Let me bring you all something to eat

I bet you're tired from the years spent on your feet

I got you, don't worry Circe's got you now

For inside the meal, think of your past

She had cast a spell, and your mistakes

They began to squeal, they'll be the last

And grow snouts and tails, mistakes you'll make

She changed them

I got all the power, yeah, I got all the power

No, I'm not a player, I'm a puppeteer

No, I don't play, I puppeteer, yeah

They transformed, this is the price

And it wasn't quick, we pay to live

She turned our men, the world does not

From men to pigs, tend to forgive

She changed them

I got all the power, yeah, I got all the power

No, I'm not a player, I'm a puppeteer

No, I don't play, I puppeteer, yeah"

But now that I see we've done some damage

Maybe you and I can make a deal

I'll give you our finest treasure

So long as we leave alive

You can keep the world's best tasting wine

Have a drink

One sip and you'll understand

The power that's in your hands

Days and nights I wish that I could show you

For twenty years I never could outgrow you

Used to say I'd capture wind and sky for you

Held you in my arms prepared to die for you, oh

How times has flown

I can only wonder

What your world has been

Things you've had to suffer

And the strength you hold within

All I've ever wanted

Was to reunite with my own

Where is he? Where is he?

Keep your head down, he's aiming for the torches

Is it finally time for the challenge I arranged?

Whoever can string my husband's old bow

And shoot through 12 axes cleanly

Will be the new king, sit down at the throne

And rule with me as their queen

Let the arrow fly
