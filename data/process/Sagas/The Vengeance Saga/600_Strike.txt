600 Strike

 (Six Hundred Strike)

[ENSEMBLE]

Six hundred men (Six hundred)

Six hundred men (Six hundred)

Six hundred men (Six hundred)

Six hundred men (Six hundred)

[ODYSSEUS]

I don't think you seem to get it

I can't afford to die

'Cause I will get back to my son

And I will get back to my wife

For every comrade, every one of my friends

Almost all of whom were slaughtered by your hand

Six hundred strike

[ENSEMBLE]

Six hundred men (Six hundred)

Six hundred men (Six hundred)

Six hundred men (Six hundred)

Six hundred, six hundred m?n

[POSEIDON]

You idiot

[POSEIDON]

Can't you see?

You sealed your fate just to b?at me

You released my storm when you opened that bag

Blocked your one way home

Now you'll never get back

[ODYSSEUS]

You're goin' to call off that storm

[POSEIDON]

Or what? You can't kill me

[ODYSSEUS]

Exactly

[ODYSSEUS]

[POSEIDON]

Wait

Wait, ahh

Ugh

[ODYSSEUS, POSEIDON]

How does it feel to be helpless? (Argh)

How does it feel to know pain? (Ugh)

I watched my friends die in horror (Ah-ah)

Crying as they were all slain (Ugh)

I heard their final moments (Argh)

Calling their captain in vain (Ugh)

Look what you turned me into (Ah-ah)

Look what we've become (Ugh, enough)

All of the pain that I've been through (Stop)

Haven't I suffered enough? (Stop)

You didn't stop when I begged you

Told me to close my heart (You)

You said the world was dark (Monster)

Didn't you say that ruthlessness is mercy upon our—

[POSEIDON]

Alright, please

[ODYSSEUS]

[POSEIDON]

After everything you've done

How will you sleep at night?

[ODYSSEUS]

Next to my wife
