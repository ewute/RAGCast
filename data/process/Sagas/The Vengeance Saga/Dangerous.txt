Hermes?

[HERMES]

Ahahahahaha, hello old friend

[ODYSSEUS]

So you're the one who talked to Calypso?

Why are you here?

[HERMES]

You're being given a final option

Consider this your one last chance

To make it back home and abandon caution

Wash it away like the blood your hands have known

I know if you dance with fate

Then I know, I know you'll enhance your state

[ODYSSEUS]

If your plan's so great then why'd you wait to say it?

[HERMES]

Well it's a little bit dangerous, my friend

You'll need a mindset change for this

You cannot get away with playing safe for this

You wanna get home?

Put it all on the line

And put your whol? brain in it

Remember ?very trick in your domain for this

You gotta treat it like it is the main event

You wanna get home?

Put it all on the line

Be dangerous

[ODYSSEUS]

Alright, I'm in, what do I do?

[HERMES]

First stop, uncharted waters

When lost, look towards the sky

Follow the north star, no matter how far

You think you're going, you keep on rowing

When strangers lurk around the isle

When danger greets you with a smile

Fight your way through, do what you must do

But no matter what, keep moving

It's gonna be dangerous, my friend

You'll need a mindset change for this

You cannot get away with playing safe for this

You wanna get home?

Put it all on the line

And put your whole brain in it

Remember every trick in your domain for this

You gotta treat it like it is the main event

You wanna get home?

Put it all on the line

Be dangerous
