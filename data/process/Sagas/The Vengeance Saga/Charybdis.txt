Charybdis

 [ODYSSEUS]

You must be who Hermes mentioned

A monster here to block my way

I'd like to hurry up and end this

So if you don't have much to say

Then oh, bring it on

I'm not dying here, I'm still fighting here

I'm holding on

Til I see it through, til I've beaten you

I already know your tactics

When you swallow you attack with whirlpools that attract prey

But I see a disadvantage, cause I don't even have to kill you

I'll just have to avoid you

See, if you don't spit it out soon, all that water will destroy you

Oh, bring it on

Til you're out of breath, til there's nothing left

I'm holding on

Til I'm in the clear, til I'm out of here, oh
