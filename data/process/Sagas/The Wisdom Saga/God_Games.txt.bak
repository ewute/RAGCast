God Games

            [ATHENA]


Father, God King, rarely do I ask for favors


Now, I'm knocking on your door


With hopes to save a friendship


With one who's a prisoner far from home


Odysseus


[ZEUS]


Divine intervention — is that what you seek?


To untie apprehensions that were placed on that Greek?


You are playing with thunder for a man full of shame


But if he's worth the risk of going under


[ZEUS, spoken]


Why not make it a game?


Convince each of them that he ought to be released


And I'll release him


[ATHENA, spoken]


Who's them?


[ZEUS, spoken]


Apollo, Hephaestus


Aphrodite, Ares


H?ra or me


What do you say?


[APOLLO, spoken]


Great


[HEPHAESTUS, spoken]


Very well


[APHRODITE, spoken]


Eh


[ARES, spoken]


Alright


[HERA, spoken]


Groovy


[ATHENA, spoken]


Bring it!


[ENSEMBLE]


Apollo


[APOLLO]


You all know I'm a fan of catchy songs


So with so many sirens gone


I think Ody's in the wrong


[ATHENA]


They were trying to do him worse


All he did was reimburse them


Now they'll tread with caution first


To live another day and sing another verse


[APOLLO, spoken]


If that's true, release him


[ENSEMBLE]


Hephaestus


[HEPHAESTUS]


Trust is not given; it's forged


Why should I give him my support?


He sacrificed his own cohort


[ATHENA]


Did you forget they failed to listen?


He was betrayed and then imprisoned


But if you make the right decision


He can still build a future with those who miss him


[HEPHAESTUS, spoken]


Fine, release him


[ENSEMBLE]


Aphrodite


[APHRODITE]


Your little high and mighty Odysseus


Claims to love his mother but lets her die of a broken heart


[ATHENA]


He was busy fighting


[APHRODITE]


More like busy spiting the cyclops


Let him feel the pain that his mother felt and rot


[ATHENA, spoken]


Wait


[ATHENA]


Please reconsider this


[ARES]


Really, Athena? These old tricks?


[ATHENA, spoken]


Ares


[ENSEMBLE]


Ares, Ares


[ARES]


What kind of sick coward holds back his power


While his friends get devoured?


He didn't even fight Scylla, didn't even try to kill her


Hides inside a wooden horse to get the job done


Never handles things upfront


Pathetic and weak like his son


[ATHENA]


Hold your tongue now, his son's my friend


And tell your lover that a broken heart can mend


Do you want more bloodshed? Then set him free


To get back to his homestead, he'll make everybody bleed


[APHRODITE & ARES, spoken]


Ugh, release him


[HERA, spoken]


Hey, baby


[ENSEMBLE]


Hera


[HERA]


So many heroes, so many tales


Give me one good reason why yours should prevail


[ATHENA]


He's got the mind of a genius


[HERA]


Try harder


[ATHENA]


He's pretty skilled with words


[HERA]


You can do better than that


[ATHENA]


He's kind of funny


[HERA, spoken]


Eh


[ATHENA, spoken]


Never once has he cheated on his wife


[HERA, spoken]


Release him


[ATHENA, spoken]


I've played your game and won. release him


[ZEUS]


You dare to defy me, to make me feel shame?


[ZEUS, spoken]


No one beats me, no one wins my game


[ZEUS & ENSEMBLE]


Thunder, bring her through the wringer


Show her I'm the judgment call


The one who makes her kingdom fall


[ARES, spoken]


Is she dead?


[Instrumental Interlude]


[ATHENA]


Let him go, please


Let him go
