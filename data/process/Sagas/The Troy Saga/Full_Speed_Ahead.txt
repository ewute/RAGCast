Full Speed Ahead

 [ODYSSEUS, SOLDIERS, ALL, EURYLOCHUS, POLITES, ODYSSSEUS]

Six hundred men, six hundred men under my command

With only one goal in mind

Make it back alive to our homeland

Six hundred men, six hundred miles of open sea

But the problem's not the distance

It's what lies in between

And Ithaca's waiting Ithaca's waiting

My kingdom is waiting The kingdom is waiting

Penelope's waiting for me

So full speed ahead, full speed ahead

[EURYLOCHUS, SOLDIERS]

Captain, Eurylochus

Six hundred men Six hundred men

Six hundred men with big mouths to feed, and we've run out of supplies to eat

Curse the war, our food store's depleted

Six hundred men Six hundred men

Six hundred reasons to take what we can

So captain, what's the plan?

Captain, what's the plan?

[ODYSSEUS, SOLDIERS, ALL, EURYLOCHUS, POLITES, ODYSSSEUS]

Watch where the birds fly

Watch where the birds fly

They will lead us to land

They will lead us to land

There we'll hunt for food, my second in command

Now full speed ahead, full speed ahead

[EURYLOCHUS, SOLDIERS, ODYSSEUS]

We're up, we're off, and away we go

We're up, we're off, and away we go (Full speed ahead)

We're up, we're off, and away we go

[POLITES]

Captain

[ODYSSEUS]

Polites!

[POLITES]

Look! There in the distance, I see an island

I see a light that faintly glows

Maybe they're people lighting a fire

Maybe they'll share some food, who knows?

[ODYSSEUS]

Something feels off here

I see fire but there's no smoke

[EURYLOCHUS]

I say we strike first, we don't have time to waste

So let's raid the place and...

[ODYSSEUS]

No

Polites gear up, you and I'll go ahead

[POLITES]

You and I'll go ahead

[ODYSSEUS]

We should try to find a way no one ends up dead

[EURYLOCHUS]

We don't know what's ahead

[ODYSSSEUS, SOLDIERS, ODYSSEUS, ALL, EURYLOCHUS, POLITES]

Give me 'til sunrise, and if we don't return

Then six hundred men can make this whole place burn

Now full speed ahead

Full speed ahead

Full speed ahead

We're up, we're off, and away we go

We're up, we're off, and away we go

Full speed ahead

We're up, we're off, and away we go

We're up, we're off, and a-

Full speed ahead
