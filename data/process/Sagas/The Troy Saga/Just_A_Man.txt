Just A Man

 [ODYSSEUS, CREW]

I look into your eyes and I

Think back to the son of mine

You're as old as he was when I left for war

Will these actions haunt my days

Every man I’ve slain?

Is the price I pay endless pain?

Close your eyes and spare yourself the view

How could I hurt you??

I'm just a man who's trying to go home

Even after all the years away from what I’ve known

I'm just a man who's fighting for his life

Deep down I would trade the world to see my son and wife

I'm just a man

But when does a comet become a meteor?

When does a candl? become a blaze?

Wh?n does a man become a monster?

When does a ripple become a tidal wave?

When does the reason become the blame?

When does a man become a monster?

When does a comet become a meteor?

When does a candle become a blaze? Forgive me

When does a man become a monster? Forgive me

When does a man become a monster? Forgive me

I'm just a man
