The Horse and the Infant

 [ODYSSEUS, SOLDIERS]

Alright, my brothers, listen closely

Tonight, we make the Trojans pay

Ten years of war, they killed us slowly

But now we'll be the ones who slay

Think of your wives and your children

Your families wonder where you've been

They're growing old, and yet you're still here

Do what I say and you'll see them again

Yes sir!

Diomedes will lead the charge

Agamemnon will flank the guards

Menelaus will let our mates through the gates to take the whole city at large

Teucer will shoot any ambush attack

And Little Ajax will stay back

Nestor, secure Helen and protect her

Neo, avenge your father, kill the brothers of Hector!

[SOLDIERS]

Yes sir!

[ODYSSEUS]

Find that inner strength now

Use that well of pride

Fight through every pain now

Ask yourself inside

What do you live for?

What do you try for?

What do you wish for?

What do you fight for?

[SOLDIERS]

What do you live for?

What do you try for?

What do you wish for?

What do you fight for?

[ODYSSEUS]

Penelope...

Penelope...

And Telemachus

I fight for us, I fight for us

[SOLDIERS]

What do you live for?

[ODYSSEUS]

Penelope

[SOLDIERS]

What do you try for?

[ODYSSEUS]

Telemachus

[SOLDIERS]

What do you wish for?

[ODYSSEUS]

I'm on my way

[SOLDIERS]

What do you fight for?

[ODYSSEUS]

Attack!

Aargh

Who was that?

[ZEUS]

A vision of what is to come cannot be outrun, can only be dealt with right here and now

[ODYSSEUS]

Tell me how

[ZEUS]

I don't think you're ready

A mission to kill someone's son, a foe who won't run, unlike anyone you have faced before

[ODYSSEUS]

Say no more, I know that I'm ready

[ZEUS]

I don't think you're ready

[ODYSSEUS]

It's just an infant, it's just a boy, what sort of imminent threat does he pose that I cannot avoid?

[ZEUS, ENSEMBLE]

This is the son of none other than Troy's very own prince Hector, know that he will grow from a boy to an avenger

One fuelled with rage as you're consumed by age

If you don't end him now, you'll have no one left to save

You can say goodbye to

Penelope

You can say goodbye to Penelope

[ODYSSEUS, ZEUS]

I could raise him as my own (He will burn your house and throne)

Or send him far away from home (He'll find you wherever you go)

Make sure his past is never known (The gods will make it known)

I'd rather bleed for ya, down on my knees for ya (He's bringing you down on your knees for ya)

I'm begging, please

Oh, this is the will of the gods

Please don't make me do this, don't make me do this

[ZEUS]

The blood on your hands is something you won't lose

[ODYSSEUS, SOLDIERS, ZEUS, ENSEMBLE, ALL]

All you can choose is whose
