Storm

            [ODYSSEUS]


These waves and tides


Have grown in strength and size


Is it nature or divine


Or a blessing in disguise?


Our home's in sight


This storm's our final fight


There's no time to die


Comrades?


[SOLDIERS]


Sir!


[ODYSSEUS, SOLDIERS]


Brace for a storm


Storm


The likes of which we've never seen before


Brace for a storm


Storm


With home so close, we must keep pushing forward


Full speed ahead


[ODYSSEUS]


Head towards the island but avoid the crashing waves


Tread where the tide is flat and then you will be saf?


[EURYLOCHUS]


Captain, we will capsize with thes? waves, our fleet will fail


[ODYSSEUS]


Have them follow my ship, I'll ensure that we prevail


[ODYSSEUS, SOLDIERS]


Storm


Storm


[EURYLOCHUS]


We're taking too much damage to survive


[ODYSSEUS, SOLDIERS]


We'll beat this storm


Storm


[EURYLOCHUS]


At this rate, we won't make it out alive


[PERIMEDES/ELPENOR, spoken]


Captain, look!


[ODYSSEUS & EURYLOCHUS]


An island in the sky


[ODYSSEUS]


Eurylochus, grab the harpoons


As many as you can find


[EURYLOCHUS]


What do you have in mind?


[ODYSSEUS]


We're gonna shoot for the sky


[EURYLOCHUS, spoken]


What?


[SOLDIERS]


Storm, storm


[ODYSSEUS]


Everyone grab a harpoon and aim it high


[SOLDIERS]


Storm, storm


[ODYSSEUS]


We're shooting for the island in the sky


In the sky


[SOLDIERS]


Storm, storm
