Done For

 [ODYSSEUS]

Lady of the palace, sorry that I ask this

But I hope that I've been misinformed

I sent out some scouts to take a look around through

Here and they wound up at your door

Through the years we seldom

Get a warm welcome, so

I must ask just to be sure

Did you do something to them?

[CIRCE]

Who, me?

All I did was reveal their true forms

[ODYSSEUS]

You turned them into pigs

[CIRCE]

Huh

I don't know who you are nor why you're here

But let me make this one thing clear

I've got people to protect

Nymphs I can't n?glect

So I'm not taking chances, dear

If you mak? one wrong move, then you're done for

Anything I don't approve, then you're done for

I could put a spell on you and you're done for

Boy, you better run or soon you will done for

[ODYSSEUS]

I don't mean to tip your scale but

You will fail at

Placing any spells on me

I just ate a flower

One that claims your power

So you better cower now and flee

[CIRCE]

You must be a liar

Mortals can't acquire

Moly without dire consequence

[ODYSSEUS]

Then I must be a god like you

Cause I got this root from the ground with my bare hands

[CIRCE]

Hermes gave it to you, didn't he?

[ODYSSEUS]

Okay, fine, yes, but regardless

[ODYSSEUS]

You and I are now evenly matched

Our fates are intertwined, they're attached

[ODYSSEUS, CIRCE]

I've got people to protect, friends I can't neglect

So now there is no turning back

You've made your one wrong move, now you're done for

I will be the one to prove that you're done for

Not even a spell saves you, cause you're done for

Oh, you better run or soon you will be done for

[ODYSSEUS]

You've lost

[CIRCE]

My nymphs are like my daughters

I protect them at all costs

The last time we let strangers live

We faced a heavy loss

You've given me no reason to

Bestow you with my trust

But everyone's true colours are

Revealed in acts of lust

[ODYSSEUS]

I'm not sure I follow
