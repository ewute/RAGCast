My Goodbye

 [ATHENA, ODYSSEUS]

You were reckless, sentimental at best

That's not a teaching of mine

You’ve grown soft, your dead friends can attest

Hey!

Put your emotions aside

You're a warrior meant to lead the rest

I don't know where I went wrong

But I warned ya’, and you failed the test

So now I'm gone

This way, you'll know what your place is

This way, you can't cross the line

This way, when all is over you'll keep yours and I'll keep mine

This way, you won't disappoint me

This way, you won't waste my time

This way, I’ll close the door

Consider this as my goodbye

[ODYSSEUS]

That’s just lik? you, why should I be surprised?

Selfish and prid?ful and vain

Unlike you, every time someone dies

I'm left to deal with the strain

What’s a title that a goddess could lend if I'll never sleep at night?

I'll remind you I saw you as a friend

But now we're done

This way, you’re out of my head now

This way, you won't plague my life

This way, when all is done, you're out of sight and out of mind

This way, you get what you wanted

This way, you can save your time

This way, you close the door and have your damn goodbye

[ATHENA]

You're not looking for a mentor

I'm not looking for a friend

I mistook you for a general

What a waste of effort spent

[ODYSSEUS]

At least I know what I'm fighting for

While you're fighting to be known

Since you claim you're so much wiser

Why's your life spent all alone?

You're alone

[ATHENA]

One day, you'll hear what I'm saying

One day, you might understand

One day, but not today, for after all you're

[ENSEMBLE]

Just a man

[ATHENA, ENSEMBLE]

This day, you sever your own head

This day, you cut the line

This day, you lost it all

Consider this as my goodbye

Ohh

Consider this as my goodbye

Ohh

This is my goodbye

Ohh

Consider this as my goodbye

Ohh

This is my goodbye
