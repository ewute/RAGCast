The Challenge

            [PENELOPE]


I'm supposed to choose a suitor to wear the crown


I said I would choose as soon as I weave this shroud


They don't know


That every night


I unthread all the work I've done


Cause I'd rather lie Than allow them to think they've won


Though I never thought I would resort to this


Just know I'll be here


Though I don't know how much longer I'll last


Since we saw that storm


And though it was so close to our kingdom


It was far from the norm


Unless


Oh, could it be some kind of sign


That my world is all about to change?


Is it finally time for the challenge I arranged?


Though I never thought that it would come to this


Just know I'll be here buying you time


[THE SUITORS]


Time is fleeting, it's running out


Time to be the man of the house (Penelope)


[PENELOPE]


Oh! Buying you time


[THE SUITORS]


Time is fleeting, it's running out


Time to be the man of the house (Penelope)


[PENELOPE]


Whoever can string my husband's old bow


And shoot through 12 axes cleanly


Will be the new king, sit down at the throne


And rule with me as their queen


Let the arrow fly


Once you know that your aim is true


Cause I'd rather die than grow old without the best of you


Though I never thought that these would be the lengths we'd go for love


I would not have it any other way


And though I never thought that it would end like this


Just know, I'll be here


Waiting, waiting


[SUITORS]


Penelope


[PENELOPE]


Waiting, waiting


[SUITORS]


Penelope


[PENELOPE]


Waiting, waiting


Oh
