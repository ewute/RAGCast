Would You Fall In Love With Me Again

            [ODYSSEUS]


Penelope


[ODYSSEUS] (opens the door of the bedroom)


[PENELOPE]


Is it you? Have my prayers been answered?


Is it really you standing there, or am I dreaming once more?


You look different, your eyes look tired


Your frame is lighter, your smile torn


Is it really you, my love?


[ODYSSEUS]


I am not the man you fell in love with


I am not the man you once adored


I am not your kind and gentle husband


And I am not the love you knew before


Would you fall in love with me again


If you knew all I've done?


The things I cannot change


Would you love me all the same?


I know that you've been waiting, waiting for love


[PENELOPE]


What kinds of things did you do?


[ODYSSEUS]


Left a trail of red on every island


As I traded friends like objects, I could use


Hurt more lives than I can count on my hands


But all of that was to bring me back to you


So tell me


Would you fall in love with me again


If you knew all I've done?


The things I can't undo


I am not the man you knew


I know that you've been waiting, waiting


[PENELOPE]


If that's true, could you do me a favor?


Just a moment of labor that would bring me some peace


See that wedding bed? Could you carry it over?


Lift it high on your shoulders and take it far away from here


[ODYSSEUS]


How could you say this?


I had built that wedding bed with my blood and sweat


Carved it into the olive tree where we first met


A symbol of our love everlasting


Do you realize what you have asked me?


The only way to move it is to cut it from its roots


[PENELOPE]


Only my husband knew that


So I guess that makes him you


[ODYSSEUS]


Penelope


[PENELOPE]


I will fall in love with you over and over again


I don't care how, where, or when


No matter how long it's been, you're mine


Don't tell me you're not the same person


You're always my husband, and I've been waiting, waiting


[ODYSSEUS]


Penelope


[PENELOPE, ODYSSEUS]


Waiting, waiting (Penelope)


Waiting, waiting


Waiting, oh


For you


[Instrumental Break]


[PENELOPE]


How long has it been?


[ODYSSEUS]


Twenty years


[PENELOPE, PENELOPE & ODYSSEUS]


I love you
