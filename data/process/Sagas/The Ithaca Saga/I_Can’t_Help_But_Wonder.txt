I Can’t Help But Wonder

 [TELEMACHUS]

Father?

All my life, I'd have died to meet you

Thought about your name so much it hurts

For twenty years I'd dreamt of how I'd greet you

Oh, and now you're here

I can't find the words

All my life I'd have died to know you

Days and nights I wish that I could show you

For twenty years I never could outgrow you

Oh, and now you're here

I can't help but wonder

What your world must be

If we're like each other

If I have your strength in me

I can't help but feel like

Sorrow's all I've known

And I can't help but realize

For so long I've felt alone

[ODYSSEUS]

Oh my son, look how much you've grown

Oh my boy, the sweetest joy I've known

Twenty years ago I held you in my arms

How time has flown, oh

Used to say I'd make the storm clouds cry for you

Used to say I'd capture wind and sky for you

Held you in my arms prepared to die for you, oh

How times has flown

I can only wonder

What your world has been

Things you've had to suffer

And the strength you hold within

All I've ever wanted

Was to reunite with my own

20 years we've wandered

But today you're not alone

My son, I'm finally home!
