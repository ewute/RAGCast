The Circe Saga,Done For,Odysseus,"Lady of the palace, sorry that I ask this"
The Circe Saga,Done For,Odysseus,But I hope that I've been misinformed
The Circe Saga,Done For,Odysseus,I sent out some scouts to take a look around through
The Circe Saga,Done For,Odysseus,Here and they wound up at your door
The Circe Saga,Done For,Odysseus,Through the years we seldom
The Circe Saga,Done For,Odysseus,"Get a warm welcome, so"
The Circe Saga,Done For,Odysseus,I must ask just to be sure
The Circe Saga,Done For,Odysseus,Did you do something to them?
The Circe Saga,Done For,Circe,"Who, me?"
The Circe Saga,Done For,Circe,All I did was reveal their true forms
The Circe Saga,Done For,Odysseus,You turned them into pigs
The Circe Saga,Done For,Circe,Huh
The Circe Saga,Done For,Circe,I don't know who you are nor why you're here
The Circe Saga,Done For,Circe,But let me make this one thing clear

The Underworld Saga,Monster,Odysseus,When the witch turns men to pigs to protect her nymphs
The Underworld Saga,Monster,Odysseus,Is she going insane?
The Underworld Saga,Monster,Odysseus,Or did she learn to be colder when she got older and now she saves them the pain?
The Underworld Saga,Monster,Odysseus,When a god comes down and makes a fleet drown
The Underworld Saga,Monster,Odysseus,Is he scared that he's doing something wrong?
The Underworld Saga,Monster,Odysseus,Or does he keep us in check so we must respect him
The Underworld Saga,Monster,Odysseus,And now no one dares to piss him off?
The Underworld Saga,Monster,Odysseus,Does a soldier use a wooden horse to kill sleeping Trojans cause he is vile?
The Underworld Saga,Monster,Odysseus,Or does he throw away his remorse and save more lives with guile

The Thunder Saga,Suffering,Penelope,Come play with me and our daughter and let’s watch our love leave the ground
The Thunder Saga,Suffering,Odysseus,"Oh, I would"
The Thunder Saga,Suffering,Odysseus,But I’d be suffering trying to float the whole time
The Thunder Saga,Suffering,Penelope,I would take the suffering from you
The Thunder Saga,Suffering,Odysseus,"Oh, as good as it sounds, right here I’m just fin?"
The Thunder Saga,Suffering,Penelope,I could take the suffering from you
The Thunder Saga,Suffering,Odysseus,You know that I pr?fer my feet on the ground
The Thunder Saga,Suffering,Penelope,I will take the suffering from you
The Thunder Saga,Suffering,Odysseus,"Fine, but only if you answer a question or two"
The Thunder Saga,Suffering,Penelope,Of course!
The Thunder Saga,Suffering,Odysseus,"Okay, so let’s say I was on the run or hiding…"
The Thunder Saga,Suffering,Odysseus,From I don’t know Poseidon…
The Thunder Saga,Suffering,Odysseus,And let’s say he blocked the way home with giant waves and giant storms
The Thunder Saga,Suffering,Penelope,Oh no!
The Thunder Saga,Suffering,Odysseus,How am I to evade him?
The Thunder Saga,Suffering,Odysseus,How am I to get home?
The Thunder Saga,Suffering,Odysseus,Which route should I take?
The Thunder Saga,Suffering,Odysseus,Where am I supposed to go?
The Thunder Saga,Suffering,Penelope,He will chase you high and low
The Thunder Saga,Suffering,Penelope,So find a place he’d never go
The Thunder Saga,Suffering,Penelope,The one way you'll get home
The Thunder Saga,Suffering,Penelope,"Is sailing where he's scared to roam, oh"
The Thunder Saga,Suffering,Penelope,It’s through the lair of Scylla
The Thunder Saga,Suffering,Odysseus,No...
The Thunder Saga,Suffering,Penelope,This is your only way home
The Thunder Saga,Suffering,Penelope,The lair of Scylla
The Thunder Saga,Suffering,Odysseus,But Scylla has a cost
The Thunder Saga,Suffering,Penelope,"Well, you asked and now you know"
The Thunder Saga,Suffering,Penelope,Now jump in the water!
The Thunder Saga,Suffering,Odysseus,"Penelope, why?"
The Thunder Saga,Suffering,Odysseus,You know I’m too shy and terrified
The Thunder Saga,Suffering,Penelope,I would take the suffering from you
The Thunder Saga,Suffering,Odysseus,"Oh, for you, I would die, but can't you let me stay dry?"
The Thunder Saga,Suffering,Penelope,I could take the suffering from you
The Thunder Saga,Suffering,Odysseus,You should come onto the ship
The Thunder Saga,Suffering,Odysseus,We'll jump at the same time
The Thunder Saga,Suffering,Penelope,I will take the suffering from you
The Thunder Saga,Suffering,Odysseus,"Ah, the things I do for you"
The Thunder Saga,Different Beast,Odysseus,"Let's cut this charade, you are no wife of mine"
The Thunder Saga,Different Beast,Odysseus,You've been tryna take my life this whole time
The Thunder Saga,Different Beast,Odysseus,"I know underwater, there are packs of you hiding"
The Thunder Saga,Different Beast,Odysseus,"Yeah, I know exactly what you are: a siren"
The Thunder Saga,Different Beast,Odysseus,My real wife knows I'm not scared of the water
The Thunder Saga,Different Beast,Odysseus,And my real wife knows I don't have a daughter
The Thunder Saga,Different Beast,Odysseus,But while you were so focused on turning my men into snacks
The Thunder Saga,Different Beast,Odysseus,You didn't notice that your friends got snatched
The Thunder Saga,Different Beast,Odysseus,We are a different beast now
The Thunder Saga,Different Beast,Soldiers,We are a different beast now
The Thunder Saga,Different Beast,Odysseus,We ar? the ones who feast now
The Thunder Saga,Different Beast,Soldiers,We ar? the ones who feast now
The Thunder Saga,Different Beast,Odysseus,"No mor? of us decease, 'cause we won't take more suffering from you"
The Thunder Saga,Different Beast,Soldiers,"No mor? of us decease, 'cause we won't take more suffering from you"
The Thunder Saga,Different Beast,Odysseus,We are the man-made monsters
The Thunder Saga,Different Beast,Soldiers,We are the man-made monsters

The Thunder Saga,Different Beast,Odysseus,We won't take more suffering from you
The Thunder Saga,Different Beast,Soldiers,We won't take more suffering from you
The Thunder Saga,Different Beast,Odysseus,We've been away from home for about 12 years or so
The Thunder Saga,Different Beast,Odysseus,First we slayed in our own war
The Thunder Saga,Different Beast,Odysseus,"And now, we're here with more foes"
The Thunder Saga,Different Beast,Odysseus,While on the run from Poseidon
The Thunder Saga,Different Beast,Odysseus,We found a ship with no crew
The Thunder Saga,Different Beast,Odysseus,"I realised nearby, there were sirens"
The Thunder Saga,Different Beast,Odysseus,Singing sailors to their dooms
The Thunder Saga,Different Beast,Odysseus,We filled our ears with beeswax
The Thunder Saga,Different Beast,Odysseus,That's how we resist your song
The Thunder Saga,Different Beast,Odysseus,"You pretended to be my wife, so I just played along"
The Thunder Saga,Different Beast,Odysseus,I read your lips and phrases
The Thunder Saga,Different Beast,Odysseus,Scanning for information
The Thunder Saga,Different Beast,Odysseus,Sirens know about every route and horizon
The Thunder Saga,Different Beast,Odysseus,Now I know how to get back to my island
The Thunder Saga,Different Beast,Soldiers,We are a different beast now
The Thunder Saga,Different Beast,Soldiers,We are the ones who feast now
The Thunder Saga,Different Beast,Soldiers,"No more of us decease, 'cause we won't take more suffering from you"
The Thunder Saga,Different Beast,Soldiers,We are the man-made monsters
The Thunder Saga,Different Beast,Soldiers,We are the ones who conquer
The Thunder Saga,Different Beast,Soldiers,You are a threat no longer
The Thunder Saga,Different Beast,Soldiers,We won't take more suffering from you
The Thunder Saga,Different Beast,Sirens,Spare us
The Thunder Saga,Different Beast,Sirens,"Oh, spare us please"
The Thunder Saga,Different Beast,Odysseus,Why?
The Thunder Saga,Different Beast,Odysseus,So you can kill the next group of sailors in this part of the sea?
The Thunder Saga,Different Beast,Odysseus,"Nah, you wouldn't have spared me"
The Thunder Saga,Different Beast,Odysseus,I made a mistake like this and almost cost my life
The Thunder Saga,Different Beast,Odysseus,I can't take more risks of not seeing my wife
