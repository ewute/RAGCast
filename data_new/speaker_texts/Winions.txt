Ha ha ha
Keep your friends close and your enemi?s closer
Never r?ally know who you can trust
If they wanna get the bag open, you gotta say "no, sir"
Sometimes killing is a must
It's treasure!
Buh-bye!
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer
Never really know who you can trust
Never really know who you can trust
Now they wanna get the bag open so they can have closure
Sometimes sneaking is a must
Sometimes sneaking is a must
'Cause the end always justifies the means
Everything's changed since Polites, so
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer
Never really know who you can trust
Never really know who you can trust
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer
Never really know who you can trust
Never really know who you can trust
Storm
Full speed ahead
Land of the giants
