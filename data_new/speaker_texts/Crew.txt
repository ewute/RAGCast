I look into your eyes and I
Think back to the son of mine
You're as old as he was when I left for war
Will these actions haunt my days
Every man I’ve slain?
Is the price I pay endless pain?
Close your eyes and spare yourself the view
How could I hurt you??
I'm just a man who's trying to go home
Even after all the years away from what I’ve known
I'm just a man who's fighting for his life
Deep down I would trade the world to see my son and wife
I'm just a man
But when does a comet become a meteor?
When does a candl? become a blaze?
Wh?n does a man become a monster?
When does a ripple become a tidal wave?
When does the reason become the blame?
When does a man become a monster?
When does a comet become a meteor?
When does a candle become a blaze? Forgive me
When does a man become a monster? Forgive me
When does a man become a monster? Forgive me
I'm just a man
Yes, but how much longer til your luck runs out?
How much longer 'til the show goes south?
How much longer 'til we all fall down?
You rely on wit, and people die on it, woah
Captain, how much longer til your luck runs out?
How much longer 'til the show goes south?
How much longer 'til we all fall down?
You rely on wit, and people die on it, woah
How much longer 'til the snake breaks free?
How much longer 'til your great days cease?
How much longer 'til your strength takes leave?
You rely on wit, and people die on it, woah
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer
Never really know who you can trust
Never really know who you can trust
Now they wanna get the bag open so they can have closure
Sometimes sneaking is a must
Sometimes sneaking is a must
'Cause the end always justifies the means
Everything's changed since Polites, so
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer
Never really know who you can trust
Never really know who you can trust
Penelope
Telemachus
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer
Never really know who you can trust
Never really know who you can trust
Storm
Full speed ahead
Storm, storm
