I lost my mentor, my mom
Six hundred lives at stake
Unlike you, every time someone dies
What?
The flames of those who've gone
Lead from the heart, and see what starts
Have grown in strength and size
I am not your kind and gentle husband
Alright, I'm in, what do I do?
Twenty years ago I held you in my arms
This way, you'll know what your place is
Six hundred lives at stake
And if I gotta drop another infant from a wall
Use that well of pride
Do what I say and you'll see them again
We should try to find a way no one ends up dead
Now full speed ahead, full speed ahead
Six hundred strike
What if I'm the monster?
You should come onto the ship
What have you done?
Who would care if we're unjust
I still believe that we could be kind
I'm on my way
I need you to always be devout and comply with this
Then we shall be on our way
You pretended to be my wife, so I just played along
I keep on trying to embrace you both
We mustn't lag
I'm not your man
You'd never wanna eat human flesh again
I'm just a man
We've been away from home for about 12 years or so
And I'll become the
Polites!
Left a trail of red on every island
Remember them
One sip and you'll understand
And now no one dares to piss him off?
We're up, we're off, and away we go
Or a blessing in disguise?
But don't forget how much we've already faced
Hermes?
Let's go!
With home so close, we must keep pushing forward
While you fed your inner beast
Goddess?
Not till the end of time, there is no way
I know you're watching me
Make a greater tomorrow, then they'll see
From I don’t know Poseidon…
Hey, Cyclops!
No
Sounds like a plan
Was to reunite with my own
What if I'm in the wrong?
Put your emotions aside
I'd like to hurry up and end this
Give me 'til sunrise, and if we don't return
When the witch turns men to pigs to protect her nymphs
But I hope that I've been misinformed
I'm gonna climb to the top and ask 'em for a hand
Six hundred men, six hundred men under my command
I won't be drawn to love in paradise
Something feels off here
No, do not
Kill them all!
And if we're defeated, they’re good as dead
They will lead us to land
Close your eyes and spare yourself the view
Or does he throw away his remorse and save more lives with guile
I already know your tactics
I am not the man you fell in love with
The things I cannot change
Brace for a storm
Eurylochus, grab the harpoons
I am your darkest moment
Almost all of whom were slaughtered by your hand
Ask yourself inside
Nah, don't be modest
How does it feel to be helpless? (Argh)
I know that you've been waiting, waiting
I built it
Look what we've become (Ugh, enough)
I ask for your assistance
Oh my son, look how much you've grown
Is this what it means to be a warrior of the mind?
We won't take more suffering from you
Or does he keep us in check so we must respect him
Where am I supposed to go?
I know you're a goddess
Singing sailors to their dooms
More than you know
Is he scared that he's doing something wrong?
This way, you get what you wanted
This is the price we pay to love, I'm just a man
Do you realize what you have asked me?
Our home's in sight
Okay, fine, yes, but regardless
But today you're not alone
We must live through this day so
I'm the reigning king of Ithaca
When you swallow you attack with whirlpools that attract prey
Show me how great is your will to survive
But when does a comet become a meteor?
So you better cower now and flee
A game?
We are not to let them die in vain
But a monster to ourselves?
When mercy is a skill more of this world could learn to use
She's my wife
Calypso
Oh, this is the will of the gods
I'll remind you I saw you as a friend
Defeat is not allowed
Nah, you wouldn't have spared me
Bestest of friends
If there's a problem, we'll have the answer
No
That's how we resist your song
Greet the world with open arms
For nine days, I've stayed wide awake
Hey!
Like none they've ever known
And suddenly you doubt that I could figure this out?
But I see a disadvantage, cause I don't even have to kill you
Or does he end my men to avenge his friend
With only one goal in mind
Now full speed ahead
That's what we'd get with open arms
And stay in his blindspot and strike his heels, strike the heels
Nothing's what it seems
Cause I got this root from the ground with my bare hands
We're up, we're off, and away we go
Would you fall in love with me again
(Oh) Wouldn't you like a taste of the power?
Okay?
When does a man become a monster?
I must become the
And when we kill him then our journey’s over
Make it back alive to our homeland
A gift from you and a gift from me
Let's grab the sheep and away we go
The only way to move it is to cut it from its roots
Monster
I love you
It's just an infant, it's just a boy, what sort of imminent threat does he pose that I cannot avoid?
Would you fall in love with me again
Til you're out of breath, til there's nothing left
And I'm getting closer to you
I must ask just to be sure
We're only here for food
Twenty years
Wouldn't you like to use more than words?
When a god comes down and makes a fleet drown
Or did she learn to be colder when she got older and now she saves them the pain?
What if I'm the monster
When does a candle become a blaze? Forgive me
Full speed ahead
Stop this, please
Remember them
Wait
It took me a while to notice just what kind of fruit they eat
Would you love me all the same?
Used to say I'd make the storm clouds cry for you
Show him that we're deadly, ha, ha
So long as we leave alive
Every man I’ve slain?
How could you say this?
Oh, as good as it sounds, right here I’m just fin?
Lurking deep below
No, no
What do you live for?
Full speed ahead
Lower your weapon
We can save whatever wind is left to use another day
I've got people to protect, friends I can't neglect
I love you
My comrades, this land confuses your mind
There is so much power, so much power
Damn
Is she going insane?
The best strategies we've seen
And our comrades will not die in vain
What?
The things I can't undo
Exactly
Our journey is almost done
I can't wait to make some new memories
So no matter who we find
Telemachus
Monster
But there's no puppet here
I'm begging, please
Six hundred men, six hundred miles of open sea
You’ve grown soft, your dead friends can attest
If I became the monster to everyone but us
(Oh) Deep in the night, the fight can be tragic
I no longer dream, only nightmares of those who've died
Is he up in the middle of the night?
But I’d be suffering trying to float the whole time
That they will be th? last Think of your past
This way, you won't disappoint me
Why?
When we met, I led with peace
Remember them
And then sleep knowing he has done him right?
But I can hardly sleep now knowing everything we've done
Ah, the things I do for you
He didn't notice I mixed lotus in his wine
Get a warm welcome, so
But my comrades will not die in vain
I can't have you disagreeing each route
[ODYSSEUS] (opens the door of the bedroom)
Yes I'm the same
What was it?
Hey there
Friends, Circe's instructions were clear
Crying as they were all slain (Ugh)
You can keep the world's best tasting wine
This way, you’re out of my head now
'Cause I will get back to my son
When does a man become a monster? Forgive me
But I warned ya’, and you failed the test
And then we'll make it home
You know I’m afraid of the water
What good would killing do
Have a drink
How does it feel to know pain? (Ugh)
This is how we're getting out of here
We're both hurting from losses
What do you fight for?
Stay back, I'm warning you
We have to go save them
How many floating islands have you seen before?
Please don't make me do this, don't make me do this
Until we find the prophet
Full speed ahead
Wait
We're in the home of the wind god
Storm
We're just travellers
We're the ones who carry on
For every comrade, every one of my friends
Find that inner strength now
Think back to the son of mine
This bag has the storm inside
We're up, we're off, and a-
For the fallen and afraid
So you're the one who talked to Calypso?
Goddess and man
Of that, I'm sure
I can only wonder
Penelope's waiting for me
Yes sir!
Who goes there?
What do you wish for?
Kill them all!
Time for me to be the father I never was
I will deal the blow
I'll help you conquer her
Why would the lotus eaters pass up on all this food?
Attack!
The power that's in your hands
Scatter!
Sounds too easy, what's the catch?
No dying on me now
Haha! I was lying and you fell for my bluff
I am the infamous
You were reckless, sentimental at best
Did you do something to them?
All I've ever wanted
There's only so much left we can endure
Look what you turned me into (Ah-ah)
Hermes, thank you
I'm left to deal with the strain
How times has flown
Where is this coming from, my friend?
My son, I'm finally home!
If you knew all I've done?
I'm just a man who's trying to go home
So we at last can go the distance
I am neither man nor mythical
I need to talk to you in private
Badass in the arena
It's what lies in between
(Oh) Deep in the night, the fight lasts for hours
Storm
What if the greatest threat we'll find across the sea
No mor? of us decease, 'cause we won't take more suffering from you
I made a mistake like this and almost cost my life
What if I've been far too kind to foes
So tell me
Poseidon
I had built that wedding bed with my blood and sweat
You said the world was dark (Monster)
So you can kill the next group of sailors in this part of the sea?
Can you cast the perfect winds for us and aid our journey home?
Not even a spell saves you, cause you're done for
Our foe must be thwarted right here and now
What?
Wh?n does a man become a monster?
And when we kill him then our journey’s over
And now, we're here with more foes
Things you've had to suffer
A symbol of our love everlasting
Is the cyclops struck with guilt when he kills?
In case you needed a reminder
You're as old as he was when I left for war
And here in The Underworld, the past seems close behind
As I traded friends like objects, I could use
Aargh
I am not the man you once adored
I'm just a man who's fighting for his life
Is the price I pay endless pain?
How am I to reunite with my estranged?
How am I to evade him?
This way, you close the door and have your damn goodbye
You're a warrior meant to lead the rest
Who's to say, with the mistakes I've made, Don't be afraid
Why are my eyes and my heart and my soul so heavy?
I can't take more risks of not seeing my wife
You didn't notice that your friends got snatched
I can't have you planting seeds of doubt
So now I'm gone
The blood we shed, it never dries
Maybe you and I can make a deal
So much power, so much power, forgive me
All I hear are screams, every time I dare to close my eyes
Which route should I take?
See how this bag is closed?
Remember them
But the problem's not the distance
Maybe one day we'll reach them
I remain unopposed, the bag is still closed
How time has flown, oh
The flames of those who've gone
This land confuses your mind
Stay back
I can see you
The next time that you dare choose not to spare
If you'd like to speak more, let me pull you aside then
Placing any spells on me
Told me to close my heart (You)
It's just one life to take
But there's no puppet here, here
Carved it into the olive tree where we first met
We must move quickly, we don't have much time
One that claims your power
Throw their bodies back in the water
We found a ship with no crew
First we slayed in our own war
I'm surrounded by the souls of those I've lost
Monster
But now that I see we've done some damage
This way, you can save your time
Next to my wife
When the fire begins to fade
So let's be honest
What?
You've lost
When the fire begins to fade
You've been tryna take my life this whole time
Say no more, I know that I'm ready
I'll give you our finest treasure
Full speed ahead
I'd rather bleed for ya, down on my knees for ya (He's bringing you down on your knees for ya)
You turned them into pigs
When does a ripple become a tidal wave?
And turn it to a giant spear
There's no length I wouldn't go if it was you I had to save
So if we must sail through dangerous oceans and beaches
We're the ones who carry on
Watch where the birds fly
Oh, I would
Kill 'em all!
Exhaust him, exhaust him
But not in the way that you want me to
So if you don't have much to say
We're up, we're off, and away we go
I will be the one to prove that you're done for
Push forward
It's a lotus, it controls your mind and never lets you free
No matter what we hear
I can't afford to die
Aren't you tired, Poseidon?
I don't think you seem to get it
Neo, avenge your father, kill the brothers of Hector!
Is me?
His body is blocking the path
Don't make m? fight you, brother, you know you'd have done th? same
We must live through this day so
All I gotta do is open this bag
So draw out your swords
I can only hope you'd do the same
And I am not the love you knew before
You and I are now evenly matched
When does a candl? become a blaze?
We are the man-made monsters
Polites gear up, you and I'll go ahead
I know underwater, there are packs of you hiding
Help me close the bag
Penelope
Brace for a storm
Do I need to change?
Nothing's what it seems
Then I must be a god like you
Why's your life spent all alone?
You didn't stop when I begged you
We took no pleasure in his pain
I'm just a man
Fine, but only if you answer a question or two
This way, you won't plague my life
We ar? the ones who feast now
We are not to let them die in vain
Have faith, friend, we've come this far
The flames of those who've gone
If I became the monster, and threw that guilt away
And Little Ajax will stay back
No dying on us now
No backup, no chance for support
Straight ahead, that is who we're fighting
Tell me how
And we can build their skills as we teach them
What do you try for?
Show yourself
The likes of which we've never seen before
You've heard the?legends?of the island?in the sky, this proves they're?true
We never came here to steal
But in The Underworld, the past seems close behind
When does a comet become a meteor?
Huh?
A wine so fresh
I just ate a flower
Head towards the island but avoid the crashing waves
Hahahaha
My name is Nobody, Nobody, Nobody
My brothers
And the strength you hold within
I read your lips and phrases
We come in peace
Menelaus will let our mates through the gates to take the whole city at large
Deal
Let them drown
There we'll hunt for food, my second in command
We only wanted to escape
What if I'm the one who killed you
Consider this as my goodbye
Where's the storm taking us?
So why not leave this here and just go home?
Hurt more lives than I can count on my hands
You've made your one wrong move, now you're done for
Lady of the palace, sorry that I ask this
These waves and tides
And our comrades will not die in vain
There is no line never enough, I'm just a man
There's been a misunderstanding
Attack from behind, keep distance in mind
What if I'm the problem that's been hiding all along?
Storm
No
We are a different beast now
Held you in my arms prepared to die for you, oh
I'm holding on
I understand that we're fazed
Then oh, bring it on
This way, when all is done, you're out of sight and out of mind
Haven't I suffered enough? (Stop)
I sent out some scouts to take a look around through
Show yourself
Even after all the years away from what I’ve known
I look into your eyes and I
What’s a title that a goddess could lend if I'll never sleep at night?
I understand that we're tired
Oh my boy, the sweetest joy I've known
Okay, so let’s say I was on the run or hiding…
(Oh) Wouldn't you like to have some of the magic?
See, if you don't spit it out soon, all that water will destroy you
Nothing's what it seems
That’s just lik? you, why should I be surprised?
My kingdom is waiting The kingdom is waiting
Comrades?
This way, when all is over you'll keep yours and I'll keep mine
Through the years we seldom
You are a threat no longer
I am not letting you get in my way
Defeat is not allowed
Fight, fight, fight
What?
Wouldn't you like your outcome preferred?
Surround him, surround him
We only hurt him to disarm him
Full speed ahead
Remember me
An island in the sky
But our path to home is blocked by an impenetrable storm
Hell no, I could kill you where you stand
I'm the only whose line I haven't crossed
My friend, I wish that I could say that I agree
Agamemnon will flank the guards
While you're fighting to be known
Now!
This storm's our final fight
Come on!
Yeah, I know exactly what you are: a siren
I'm no pet, I'm a married man
You will fail at
Tread where the tide is flat and then you will be saf?
Remember us
Then I'll become the
We'll jump at the same time
Thank you
It's just one life to take
I'll just have to avoid you
A monster here to block my way
If you knew all I've done?
I could raise him as my own (He will burn your house and throne)
Ah
You know I’m too shy and terrified
How has everything been turned against us?
Penelope
They will lead us to land
Watch where the birds fly
Watch out!
You're alone
And Telemachus
Penelope
Something dangerous, friends
Does a soldier use a wooden horse to kill sleeping Trojans cause he is vile?
My real wife knows I'm not scared of the water
Will these actions haunt my days
Remember them
And deep down I know this well
We are the warriors of the mind
We are the ones who conquer
You must be who Hermes mentioned
And let’s say he blocked the way home with giant waves and giant storms
I no longer dream, only nightmares of those who've died
We're up, we're off, and away we go
I took six hundred men to war and not one of them died there
We'll beat this storm
I don't know where I went wrong
But while you were so focused on turning my men into snacks
Used to say I'd capture wind and sky for you
Mark my words now, this is not the end
Tonight, we make the Trojans pay
Penelope
Fight through every pain now
No bloodshed in here today
Good
We're up, we're off, and away we go
I must get to see Penelope and Telemachus
Have them follow my ship, I'll ensure that we prevail
When does the reason become the blame?
Oh, ruthlessness is mercy upon ourselves
Wait
Fight, fight, fight
Kill them all!
How could I hurt you??
You are Athena (Athena)
No...
Remember them
We cannot let the treasure rumor fly
Stand up and fight for your lives
We filled our ears with beeswax
I heard their final moments (Argh)
I keep thinking of the infant from that night
Calling their captain in vain (Ugh)
All of the pain that I've been through (Stop)
Or we'll all die in this
I'm fine, Polites
Of course I'd like to leave now, of course I'd like to run
He can't land a blow if we're out of reach
I know that you've been waiting, waiting for love
20 years we've wandered
