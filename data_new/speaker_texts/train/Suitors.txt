Throw him down in the great below
Hold us down while the boy gets bolder
All because you had to
In the heat of battle at the edge of the unknown
Time to be the man of the house (Penelope)
Hold her down while her gate is open
Try, little wolf try
Time is fleeting, it's running out
Hold us down
Hold us down
Fly, little wolf, fly
We're empty handed up against an archer
Here and now
I'll teach you all the lessons your daddy never could
Cut him down into tiny pieces
Wanna entertain m??
Fight, little wolf, fight, little wolf, fight
Hold her down while we share her spoils
Here and now, we can take control
While the throne gets colder
Fight, little wolf, fight
L?t's see how you take this
Don't you know it's fight or
Our weapons, they're missing!
Here and now, we can take control
Wanna be a man? Then
Hold us down while the throne gets colder
Where the hell is our pride and our rage?
Time is fleeting, it's running out
Where the hell is our pride and our rage?
While we slowly age
Here and now, burn it down to ashes
When the crown wonders where the prince is
Channel the fire inside your soul
Fight, little wolf, fight
Burn it down to ashes
Hold him down while I slit his throat
Penelope
Strike, little wolf, strike
Hold us down
Our only chance is to strike him in the darkness
Hold him down while I slowly break his pride, his trust, his faith, and his bones
Penelope
Hold him down 'til the boy stops shaking
Wanna entertain me?
This cruel world doesn't give out presents just for being good
Or die, little wolf, die
Bite, little wolf, bite
We can take control
Hold 'em down, hold 'em down
Here and now, burn it down to ashes
Hold us down while we slowly age
There's a chance for action
Hold her down while I get a taste
Channel the fire inside your soul
You've made your worst mistake here, might be your last one too
Here and now, there's a chance for action
And then we'll
Here and now
We have the advantage, we've the numbers and the might
Here and now, there's a chance for action
Where is he? Where is he?
Wanna be a man? Then
Only the ocean and I will know
Let's see how you take this
Fight, little wolf, fight, little wolf, fight
