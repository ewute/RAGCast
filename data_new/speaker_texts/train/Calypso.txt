Bow down now to the immortal Calypso, here to entertain
How am I supposed to get over you?
I'm not sorry for loving you
Why did I fall in love with you?
All you could need here
Soon into bed we'll climb and spend our time
Or if I ambushed you
You're mine, all mine
Let me speak
But I'm not sorry for loving you
Then I am sorry my love's too much for you
For once, I wish you would lie and say
I'm not sorry for loving you
I thought for sure that you were my dream come true
They said they're taking you away
Just you and me, my dear my love for life
Anyways, I've got all you could want here
I'm what you need here
From here on out, you're mine, all mine
I'm angry and tired and restless and sad
And if you hate me
For that, I'll say I was wrong
Tell me, though, who's Penelope?
How am I supposed to get over you?
Someone arrived today
But fear not, I bring no pain
What do I do with this love for you?
All we could want here
I'm not sorry for loving you
I swore that you were dead
But last I checked, goddesses can't die
I'm what you want here
I'm not sorry for loving you
I thought I knew
And soon I won't get to see your face
Or if I ambushed you
I'm not sorry for loving you
Then I am sorry my love's too much for you
Did you know you talk in your sleep?
So if I pushed you
That you're not mine to save
So if I pushed you
I hate that I fell in love with you
I'm not sorry
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm stuck in the moments I swore that we had
But I'm not sorry for loving you
Or if I came on too strong
What do I do with this love for you?
When you washed up on my isle
Then I am sorry my love's too much for you
You're unlike anyone I have ever?known
Or try to embrace me
And if I?pushed you
I spent my whole life here
Just you and me, my love in paradise
Morning sleepyhead
So when you washed ashore
For that, I'll say I was wrong
I'm not sorry for loving you
Oh handsome, you may try
I'm not sorry for loving you
So I came by to say
Under my spell, we're stuck in paradise
Was cast away when I was young
For that, I'll say I was wrong
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
All we could need here
Alone for a hundred years
You've been resting for a while
Why in the world won't you love me too?
