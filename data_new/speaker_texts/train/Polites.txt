Thank you!
Greet the world with open arms
Greet the world with open arms
No matter the place, we can light up the world
Here's how to start:
I can tell you're getting nervous
This life is amazing when you greet it with open arms
I know that you're tired of the war and bloodshed
Think of all that we have been through
I can't believe this cave has all this for us to keep
Maybe they're people lighting a fire
Whatever we face, we'll be fine if we're leading from the heart
This life is amazing when you greet it with open arms
Here we have a chance for some adjustment
So do yourself a service
So why not replace it and light up the world
Here's how to start:
We'll survive what we get into
Maybe they'll share some food, who knows?
Tell me, is this how we're supposed to live?
Look! There in the distance, I see an island
I see in your face, there is so much guilt inside your heart
Whatever we face, we'll be fine if we're leading from the heart
No matter the place, we can light up the world
You can relax, my friend
You can relax, my friend
And try to relax my friend
Look at how you grip your sword, enough said
Greet the world with open arms
Look at all this food, look at all these sheep
Greet the world with open arms
Here's how to start:
When you stop and lower your guard
Greet the world with open arms
Captain…
And where do we sail to find this food-filled cave?
Lotus eaters, I'd like to show my friend that kindness is brave
Captain
Could you tell me where there's other food to eat?
