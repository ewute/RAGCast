There are other modes of control
They transformed, this is the price
And grow snouts and tails, mistakes you'll make
Hermes gave it to you, didn't he?
But let me make this one thing clear
For inside the meal, think of your past
Who's to say, with the mistakes I've made, Don't be afraid
Go ahead and rest wherever you like
There are other actions of passion
Huh
Let me bring you all something to eat
Mistakes I ever mak?? Don't break when
Welcome to the best part of your lives
I could put a spell on you and you're done for
There are other ways of persuasion
I've got people to protect, friends I can't neglect
Bestow you with my trust
She changed them
She had cast a spell, and your mistakes
And it wasn't quick, we pay to live
Oh, you better run or soon you will be done for
That they will be th? last Think of your past
No, I'm not a player, I'm a puppeteer
Nymphs I can't n?glect
You must be a liar
Show me that you're willing to burn, woah
No, I don't play, I puppeteer, yeah
I've got people to protect
Come inside
Revealed in acts of lust
There is so much power, so much power
I got you, don't worry Circe's got you now
My nymphs are like my daughters
You've made your one wrong move, now you're done for
Anything I don't approve, then you're done for
I don't know who you are nor why you're here
But there's no puppet here
I got all the power, yeah, I got all the power
Take a seat
She turned our men, the world does not
I got all the power, yeah, I got all the power
They began to squeal, they'll be the last
This is the price we pay to love, I'm just a man
I will be the one to prove that you're done for
So much power, so much power, forgive me
I got you, don't worry Circe's got you now
Want to save your men from the fire?
I protect them at all costs
You've given me no reason to
Mortals can't acquire
No, I'm not a player, I'm a puppeteer
There is no line never enough, I'm just a man
The last time we let strangers live
So I'm not taking chances, dear
If you mak? one wrong move, then you're done for
But there's no puppet here, here
But everyone's true colours are
