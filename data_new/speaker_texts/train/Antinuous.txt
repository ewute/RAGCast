Hold us down while the boy gets bolder
Fight, little wolf, fight
Hold us down
Bite, little wolf, bite
Wanna be a man? Then
Wanna be a man? Then
Hold her down while her gate is open
Here and now, we can take control
Here and now
None of us can string this, we don't?have?the power
Here and now
I'll teach you all the lessons your daddy never could
I heard he's on a diplomatic mission
Hold her down while I get a taste
Hold us down while we slowly age
When the crown wonders where the prince is
Here and now, burn it down to ashes
Haven't you noticed who's missing?
Throw him down in the great below
Fight, little wolf, fight, little wolf, fight
And then we'll
Here and now, we can take control
Screw this competition, we've been here for hours
Channel the fire inside your soul
Burn it down to ashes
The queen will have no one to
Here and now, burn it down to ashes
Don't you know the prince is not around
So
Wanna entertain me?
Run away before you
Here and now
This cruel world doesn't give out presents just for being good
We can take control
Hold her down while we share her spoils
Let's see how you take this
Hold us down
Fight, little wolf, fight, little wolf, fight
Fly, little wolf, fly
I say we gather near the beaches
Hold him down while I slit his throat
Where the hell is our pride and our rage?
Hold him down while I slowly break his pride, his trust, his faith, and his bones
Can't you?guys see we're being played?
And when the deed is done
I will not let any part go to waste
Wanna entertain m??
L?t's see how you take this
This is how they
Let us leave now, today we can strike and
All because you had to
Stop us from breaking her bedroom door
Where the hell is our pride and our rage?
Only the ocean and I will know
Strike, little wolf, strike
Hold us down while the throne gets colder
Don't you know it's fight or
I say we wait 'til he arrives
Hold 'em down, hold 'em down
Strike, little wolf, strike
While we slowly age
Channel the fire inside your soul and
Here and now, there's a chance for action
You've made your worst mistake here, might be your last one too
And I heard today he comes back to town, so
Or die, little wolf, die
