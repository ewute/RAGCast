I'll fight the harpies and chimeras
What your world must be
For twenty years I never could outgrow you
I don't think he'll mind
And so I think maybe, if life wasn't spent as planned
Just keep your eyes open
Oh, and now you're here
I know life and fate are scary
I can't help but wonder
And I would fight them if I was half as strong as you
Father?
I know life and fate are scary
Just keep your eyes open
Sorrow's all I've known
The minotaurs, even Cerberus
But she is standing tall
I'll fight the harpies and chimeras
For so long I've felt alone
All my life, I'd have died to meet you
They keep taking space and it's not much longer we can stall
I can't help but feel like
Stuck in my bedroom, living in this world you left behind
Cause I got in a fight, sailed to an island
Just keep your eyes open
Give me giants and a hydra
Can I do whatever it takes to keep my mom safe?
There are strangers in our halls
My time with you has been splendid
Days and nights I wish that I could show you
Dreaming of all these monsters that I'll never get to fight
I know life and fate are scary
For twenty years I'd dreamt of how I'd greet you
If not his friend then mine
And I can't help but realize
But I wanna be legendary
And no idea if you're dead or just too far
Give me sirens and a cyclops
If so, then
Thought about your name so much it hurts
If we're like each other
Somebody tell me, come and give me a sign
If so, then
Oh, and now you're here
Give me giants and a hydra
But I wanna be legendary
I don't know who this friend is
But I wanna be legendary
The best day of my life
Somebody help me, come and give me the strength
The minotaurs, even Cerberus
Maybe, it's time that you lend a hand
It's just me, myself, and I
When I've never left home shores
Just keep your eyes open
Cause they're getting impatient, dangerous too
