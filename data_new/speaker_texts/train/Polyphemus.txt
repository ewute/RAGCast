Wine?
Enough
You came to my home to steal
But now you'll become my meal
What gives you the right to deal a pain so deep
Your life now is in my hand
Who are you?
My favourit? sheep
Nobody, for your gift I've one to reply
Take from you like you took from me
Don't you know that pain you sow is pain you r?ap?
You will learn that it's not so fun to take
Time to drink
Before I'm done
Six hundred lives I'll break
And when I kill you then my pain is over
Yes, you shall be the final man to die
It was Nobody, Nobody
Stranger, what's your name?
Don’t go!
Your blood over where you stand
A trade, you see?
You killed my sheep
Escape is not allowed
