Sometimes killing is a must
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer
If I had to guess? You're heading to the
'Cause the end always justifies the means
Friends turn into foes and rivalries
That's what I'm serving
Everything's changed since Polites, so
All you gotta do is not open this bag
Storm
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer
I am the wind, twisting and turning
Ha ha ha
Take a look right here at this bag
I give the fire enough to stay burning
Never really know who you can trust
Never really know who you can trust (Never really know who you can trust)
Ha ha ha
Never really know who you can trust
Let's play a game
Now they wanna get the bag open so they can have closure
'Cause the end always justifies the means
Never really know who you can trust
And if you win, you will get what you're yearning
Never really know who you can trust
Never r?ally know who you can trust
I said to keep the bag closed, but you weren't compliant
It has the winds of the storm all trapped
So keep your friends close and your enemies closer
Never really know who you can trust
If they wanna get the bag open, you gotta say "no, sir"
