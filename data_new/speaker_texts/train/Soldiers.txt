I no longer dream, only nightmares of those who've died
We are the ones who feast now
We are not to let them die in vain
Give me 'til sunrise, and if we don't return
Full speed ahead
Full speed ahead
Surround him, surround him
Storm, storm
The flames of those who've gone
Six hundred men, six hundred men under my command
Nestor, secure Helen and protect her
No backup, no chance for support
Teucer will shoot any ambush attack
Brace for a storm
No dying on me now
What do you live for?
Six hundred men Six hundred men
We're up, we're off, and away we go
Now full speed ahead, full speed ahead
With home so close, we must keep pushing forward
Fight, fight, fight
And stay in his blindspot and strike his heels, strike the heels
Watch where the birds fly
Penelope's waiting for me
But now we'll be the ones who slay
We are the man-made monsters
Alright, my brothers, listen closely
How much longer must we push through doubt?
Exhaust him, exhaust him
Odysseus, Odysseus, Odysseus
Captain, what's the plan?
Oh, woah-oh-oh, oh woah-oh-oh, oh, woah-oh-oh
Nothing's what it seems
We are a different beast now
Nothing's what it seems
So full speed ahead, full speed ahead
What do you fight for?
Stand up and fight for your lives
Neo, avenge your father, kill the brothers of Hector!
Full speed ahead
No more of us decease, 'cause we won't take more suffering from you
Ruthlessness is (Captain)
You are a threat no longer
Defeat is not allowed
What do you try for?
Monster
You are a threat no longer
Monster
Eurylochus, Eurylochus, Eurylochus
Ruthlessness is (Captain) mercy upon our- Captain
He is a different beast now
We are the man-made monsters
What do you fight for?
Your families wonder where you've been
Then six hundred men can make this whole place burn
And when we kill him then our journey’s over
With only one goal in mind
Now full speed ahead
But the problem's not the distance
Storm
Agamemnon will flank the guards
For the fallen and afraid
They will lead us to land
Remember them
And our comrades will not die in vain
We're up, we're off, and away we go
No mor? of us decease, 'cause we won't take more suffering from you
What do you try for?
We'll beat this storm
Oh, woah-oh-oh, oh woah-oh-oh, oh, woah-oh-oh
Yes sir!
We must live through this day so
How much longer must we suffer now?
My kingdom is waiting The kingdom is waiting
There is no price he won't pay
Ten years of war, they killed us slowly
Six hundred men with big mouths to feed, and we've run out of supplies to eat
Sir!
Remember them
It's just one life to take
We're up, we're off, and away we go
Six hundred lives at stake
How much longer must we go about
Ruthlessness is (Captain) mercy upon our- Captain
What do you wish for?
We are a different beast now
He can't land a blow if we're out of reach
When the fire begins to fade
We are not to let them die in vain
And our comrades will not die in vain
Show me how great is your will to survive
And here in The Underworld, the past seems close behind
But in The Underworld, the past seems close behind
All I hear are screams, every time I dare to close my eyes
Storm
I no longer dream, only nightmares of those who've died
We're up, we're off, and away we go
We're up, we're off, and away we go (Full speed ahead)
Do what I say and you'll see them again
Curse the war, our food store's depleted
So draw out your swords
What do you live for?
And Ithaca's waiting Ithaca's waiting
Captain, Eurylochus
Woah
No more of us deceased, 'cause he won't take more suffering from you
We ar? the ones who feast now
The flames of those who've gone
He won't take more suffering from you
We must live through this day so
No dying on us now
Fight, fight, fight
I keep thinking of the infant from that night
What do you wish for?
Find a breach
Six hundred men, six hundred miles of open sea
We're up, we're off, and away we go
Nothing's what it seems
Oh, woah-oh-oh, oh woah-oh-oh, oh, woah-oh-oh
Full speed ahead
There we'll hunt for food, my second in command
Menelaus will let our mates through the gates to take the whole city at large
All I hear are screams, every time I dare to close my eyes
Storm
Storm, storm
I keep thinking of the infant from that night
Full speed ahead
The likes of which we've never seen before
This land confuses your mind
They're growing old, and yet you're still here
We won't take more suffering from you
We're the ones who carry on
Yes sir
Remember them
Attack from behind, keep distance in mind
Yes sir!
We're the ones who carry on
Remember them
For the fallen and afraid
Oh, woah-oh-oh, oh woah-oh-oh, oh, woah-oh-oh
He is the one who conquers
We are the ones who conquer
We won't take more suffering from you
He is the one who feasts now
