Put it all on the line
She has all the ways to haunt ya
I'll help you conquer her
Then you'll manifest a being of your creation
To make it back home and abandon caution
Wouldn't you like your outcome preferred?
You gotta treat it like it is the main event
When lost, look towards the sky
You cannot get away with playing safe for this
Consider this your one last chance
Wouldn't you like your outcome preferred?
You cannot get away with playing safe for this
Wouldn't you like a taste of the power?
You gotta treat it like it is the main event
And put your whole brain in it
Remember ?very trick in your domain for this
And put your whol? brain in it
Put it all on the line
(Oh) Deep in the night, the fight lasts for hours
Till you've beaten your opponent
Deep in the night, the fight lasts for hours
Wouldn't you like to use more than words?
Deep in the night, the fight lasts for hours
Remember every trick in your domain for this
And I call this root "holy moly"
Wouldn't you like to hav? some of the magic?
Someone who's not afraid to send a message
Well it's a little bit dangerous, my friend
Deep in the night, the fight can be tragic
You can be hurt or you can beat her
Be dangerous
That'll end up on her plate
You can be hurt or you can beat her
You wanna get home?
Be dangerous
Wouldn't you like to have some of the magic?
Though it's only for a moment
There lies such a power to take her on
Put it all on the line
Deep in the night, the fight lasts for hours
You wanna get home?
When danger greets you with a smile
Like you're on your hundredth date
Wouldn't you like your outcome preferred?
You wanna get home?
I'll help you conquer her
Wouldn't you like a taste of the power?
Oh-oh
Wouldn't you like a taste of the power?
Fight your way through, do what you must do
Wash it away like the blood your hands have known
I'll help you conquer her
Wouldn't you like to use more than words?
Wouldn't you like to use more than words?
Wouldn't you like to use more than words?
It's gonna be dangerous, my friend
She can turn you to an animal
Don't thank me, friend, you very well may die
I know if you dance with fate
Deep in the night, the fight can be tragic
She can all but make you fall in love
She can conjure up a monster
You'll need a mindset change for this
But no matter what, keep moving
Wouldn't you like your outcom? preferred?
I'll help you conquer her
Wouldn't you like to have some of the magic?
You want to beat her?
Deep in the night, the fight can be tragic
Just a friend who could help you save your men

Then I know, I know you'll enhance your state
You're being given a final option
You can be hurt or you can beat her
Mh-hm-hm, good luck
You must consume and digest it
