Never really know who you can trust
How much longer 'til your strength takes leave?
Penelope
Now they wanna get the bag open so they can have closure
Telemachus
Never really know who you can trust
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer
Will these actions haunt my days
You rely on wit, and people die on it, woah
I'm just a man who's trying to go home
How could I hurt you??
Even after all the years away from what I’ve known
How much longer 'til the snake breaks free?
How much longer 'til your great days cease?
I'm just a man
Everything's changed since Polites, so
Yes, but how much longer til your luck runs out?
I look into your eyes and I
When does a candl? become a blaze?
'Cause the end always justifies the means
Never really know who you can trust
Never really know who you can trust
Never really know who you can trust
When does a comet become a meteor?
Sometimes sneaking is a must
Think back to the son of mine
I'm just a man who's fighting for his life
You rely on wit, and people die on it, woah
Is the price I pay endless pain?
How much longer 'til we all fall down?
You rely on wit, and people die on it, woah
I'm just a man
Close your eyes and spare yourself the view
When does a ripple become a tidal wave?
When does the reason become the blame?
When does a candle become a blaze? Forgive me
Never really know who you can trust
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer
Sometimes sneaking is a must
Storm, storm
How much longer 'til we all fall down?
When does a man become a monster? Forgive me
When does a man become a monster?
How much longer 'til the show goes south?
