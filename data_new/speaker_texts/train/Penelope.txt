Waiting, waiting
Of course!
So find a place he’d never go
I would not have it any other way
Unless
I don't care how, where, or when
Don’t you miss me?
You're always my husband, and I've been waiting, waiting
Cause I'd rather die than grow old without the best of you
Just keep your eyes open
Wake up, Odysseus, they're opening the bag
Don't tell me you're not the same person
That my world is all about to change?
You look different, your eyes look tired
It’s through the lair of Scylla
I'm supposed to choose a suitor to wear the crown
I love you
Is it you? Have my prayers been answered?
Waiting, waiting
Just know I'll be here
Only my husband knew that
Cause I'd rather lie Than allow them to think they've won
For you
What kinds of things did you do?
I would take the suffering from you
Is sailing where he's scared to roam, oh
Since we saw that storm
I unthread all the work I've done
I will fall in love with you over and over again
Come play with me and our daughter and let’s watch our love leave the ground
Is it really you, my love?
So I guess that makes him you
If that's true, could you do me a favor?
Though I never thought that these would be the lengths we'd go for love
Just keep your eyes open
Oh! Buying you time
Waiting, oh
Wake up!
See that wedding bed? Could you carry it over?
Lift it high on your shoulders and take it far away from here
And though I never thought that it would end like this
He will chase you high and low
Well, you asked and now you know
Let the arrow fly
Will be the new king, sit down at the throne
And rule with me as their queen
Waiting, waiting (Penelope)
Now jump in the water!
Wake up!
Oh
This is your only way home
Is it finally time for the challenge I arranged?
It was far from the norm
Though I never thought I would resort to this
I will take the suffering from you
The one way you'll get home
And shoot through 12 axes cleanly
Though I don't know how much longer I'll last
Waiting, waiting
Whoever can string my husband's old bow
I could take the suffering from you
I love you
Just keep your eyes open
Then jump in the water and kiss me
I will take the suffering from you
Just a moment of labor that would bring me some peace
Oh no!
Waiting, waiting
Is it really you standing there, or am I dreaming once more?
