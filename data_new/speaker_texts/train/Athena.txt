Goddess of wisdom, master of war
This way, I’ll close the door
Nice try, but two can play this game
Have you forgotten the lessons I taught you?
This day, you lost it all
I know we'll change the world
Ohh
And tell your lover that a broken heart can mend
Ares
A magic boar only the best could kill
What a waste of effort spent
Consider this as my goodbye
He's got the mind of a genius
We'll see where it ends
Consider this as my goodbye
Wait
Finish it
They were trying to do him worse
Put your emotions aside
Father, God King, rarely do I ask for favors
This way, you'll know what your place is
He is a warrior of the mind
You're a warrior meant to lead the rest
No?
We are the warriors of the mind
If there's a problem, we'll have the answer
This way, you won't disappoint me
I don't know where I went wrong
I know he'll change the world
Make a greater tomorrow, then they'll see
Never once has he cheated on his wife
He was busy fighting
Have you forgotten to turn off your heart? This is not you
You're not looking for a mentor
I had a challenge, a test of skill
He's kind of funny
You are a warrior of the mind
Bring it!
All he did was reimburse them
Let him go
Please reconsider this
Have you forgotten your purpose? Let me remind you
This day, you cut the line
And we can build their skills as we teach them
Maybe one day we'll reach them
A boy whose mind rivalled the boar's own will
This way, you won't waste my time
So now I'm gone
With hopes to save a friendship
If there's a problem, he'll have the answer
Have you forgotten the lessons I taught you?
Maybe one day he'll follow me
Odysseus
How can you see through my spell?
This is my goodbye
Do you want more bloodshed? Then set him free
This day, you sever your own head
And we can build his skills as I teach him
Did you forget they failed to listen?
To live another day and sing another verse
One day, you'll hear what I'm saying
Don't forget that you're a warrior of a very special kind
He can still build a future with those who miss him
Who's them?
He's pretty skilled with words
Don't!
Consider this as my goodbye
If you're looking for a mentor, I'll make sure your time's well spent
Let him go, please
One day, but not today, for after all you're
My life has one mission, create the greatest warrior
Don't disappoint me
Hold your tongue now, his son's my friend
You were reckless, sentimental at best
'Cause he is a warrior of the mind
But I warned ya’, and you failed the test
Well done, enlighten me, what's your name?
Consider this as my goodbye
You’ve grown soft, your dead friends can attest
Ohh
Maybe one day I'll reach him
This is my goodbye
That's not a teaching of mine
Now they'll tread with caution first
