I see you on the brink of death
I am the prophet with the answers you seek
But that's not a world I know
I see you draw your final breath
Time, I've unlocked it
And a brother's final stand
I see a song of past romance
But it's no longer you
I see past and future running free
I see a man who gets to make it home alive
