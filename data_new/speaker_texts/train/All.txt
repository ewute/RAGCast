Now full speed ahead, full speed ahead
So full speed ahead, full speed ahead
Six hundred men, six hundred miles of open sea
Then six hundred men can make this whole place burn
Full speed ahead
Six hundred men, six hundred men under my command
Monster
So what if I'm the
And Ithaca's waiting Ithaca's waiting
We're up, we're off, and a-
I will deal the blow
But the problem's not the distance
Then I'll become the
Watch where the birds fly
With only one goal in mind
Full speed ahead
It's what lies in between
Monster
Full speed ahead
Monster
We're up, we're off, and away we go
And I'll become the
Watch where the birds fly
They will lead us to land
All you can choose is whose
I must become the
Lurking deep below
Now full speed ahead
Like none they've ever known
There we'll hunt for food, my second in command
We're up, we're off, and away we go
Penelope's waiting for me
