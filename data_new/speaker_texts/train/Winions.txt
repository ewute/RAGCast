Storm
Never really know who you can trust
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer
Never really know who you can trust
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer
Sometimes killing is a must
Sometimes sneaking is a must
Never really know who you can trust
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer
Now they wanna get the bag open so they can have closure
'Cause the end always justifies the means
Full speed ahead
Land of the giants
It's treasure!
Ha ha ha
Never really know who you can trust
Everything's changed since Polites, so
Never r?ally know who you can trust
Never really know who you can trust
