'Cause you're not even great
In all my years of living
Ruthlessness is mercy upon ourselves
'Cause you fight to save lives
And all his cries
I'll take your son and gouge his eyes
Now you'll never get back
Calling their captain in vain (Ugh)
Forty three left under your command
Or what? You can't kill me
And without a doubt
And yet, you hurt the son of mine
Get in the water
Get in the water
I've got a name to uphold
And now it is finally time
You didn't stop when I begged you
I'll make tidal waves so profound
Ugh
Any last words?
I heard their final moments (Argh)
After everything you've done
The world is dark and
I need to see you drown
That's what I hate
Unless, of course, you apologize
Today, you die
So close your heart
Blocked your one way home
That's right, the cyclops you made blind, is mine
For the perfect time to strike
Now get in the water
Die
Die
You have lived more than enough
I've got a reputation
Get in the water
Remember me
Odysseus of Ithaca
No
Ruthlessness is mercy upon ourselves
Told me to close my heart (You)
It isn't very often that I get pissed off
I've been so gracious
Guess the pack of wolves is swimming with the shark now
Ourselves
Look what you turned me into (Ah-ah)
Wait
Can't you see?
I've been waiting for this moment
Both your wife and your son will drown
And you've?reached your coast
Ourselves
I try to chill with the waves
I've gotta make you bleed
Unlike you I've got no mercy left to give 'cause
How will you sleep at night?
There you are, coward
Ruthlessness is mercy upon ourselves
Haven't I suffered enough? (Stop)
Ruthlessness is mercy upon ourselves
Get in the water
Ruthl?ssness is mercy upon ourselv?s
Ruthlessness is mercy upon ourselves
Ruthlessness is mercy upon ourselves
The monster that always draws near
But no
You released my storm when you opened that bag
Had you just killed my son
But damn, you crossed the line
I watched my friends die in horror (Ah-ah)
It's the final crack, we're about to break the ice now
You idiot
The line between naïveté and
For my son's pain
When your?home's?so close
So I can't go letting you walk or else the world forgets I'm cold
But before you go, I need to make you learn how
Didn't you say that ruthlessness is mercy upon our—
That's when our paths?collide
I am your darkest moment
But won't kill and don't get the job done
You said the world was dark (Monster)
Get in the water
You are far too nice
I'm left without a choice
Or I'll raise the tide so high, all of Ithaca will die
All of the pain that I've been through (Stop)
