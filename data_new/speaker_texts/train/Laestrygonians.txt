You are far too nice
Unless, of course, you apologize
Ruthlessness is (Captain) mercy upon our- Captain
Poseidon, Poseidon, Poseidon, Poseidon, Poseidon, Poseidon, Poseidon
Ruthlessness is (Captain) mercy upon our- Captain
Had you just killed my son
Ruthl?ssness is mercy upon ourselv?s
I've gotta make you bleed
You reveal your name
Unlike you I've got no mercy left to give 'cause
You are the worst kind of good
That's what I hate
Ruthlessness is mercy-
But before you go, I need to make you learn how
Ruthlessness is mercy upon ourselves
And without a doubt
To say goodbye
And all his cries
But no
Mercy has a price
A Greek who reeks of false righteousness
Ourselves
Ruthlessness is mercy upon ourselves
Ruthlessness is mercy upon ourselves
'Cause you're not even great
For my son's pain
I mean you totally could have avoided all this
Ruthlessness is mercy upon ourselves
Today, you die
Then you let him live
But won't kill and don't get the job done
I'm left without a choice
I need to see you drown
