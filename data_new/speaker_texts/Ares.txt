Alright
Really, Athena? These old tricks?
What kind of sick coward holds back his power
While his friends get devoured?
He didn't even fight Scylla, didn't even try to kill her
Hides inside a wooden horse to get the job done
Never handles things upfront
Pathetic and weak like his son
Ugh, release him
Is she dead?
