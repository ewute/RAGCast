Poseidon, Poseidon, Poseidon, Poseidon, Poseidon, Poseidon, Poseidon
I'm left without a choice
And without a doubt
Guess the pack of wolves is swimming with the shark now
I've gotta make you bleed
I need to see you drown
But before you go, I need to make you learn how
Ruthlessness is mercy upon ourselves
Ruthl?ssness is mercy upon ourselv?s
Ruthlessness is mercy upon ourselves
Ourselves
You are the worst kind of good
'Cause you're not even great
A Greek who reeks of false righteousness
That's what I hate
'Cause you fight to save lives
But won't kill and don't get the job done
I mean you totally could have avoided all this
Had you just killed my son
But no
You are far too nice
Mercy has a price
It's the final crack, we're about to break the ice now
You reveal your name
Then you let him live
Unlike you I've got no mercy left to give 'cause
Ruthlessness is mercy upon ourselves
Ruthlessness is mercy upon ourselves
Ruthlessness is mercy upon ourselves
Ourselves
And now it is finally time
To say goodbye
Today, you die
Unless, of course, you apologize
For my son's pain
And all his cries
Ruthlessness is mercy-
Ruthlessness is (Captain) mercy upon our- Captain
Ruthlessness is (Captain) mercy upon our- Captain
Ruthlessness is (Captain) mercy upon our- Captain
Ruthlessness is (Captain)
