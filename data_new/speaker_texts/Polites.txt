Captain
Look! There in the distance, I see an island
I see a light that faintly glows
Maybe they're people lighting a fire
Maybe they'll share some food, who knows?
You and I'll go ahead
You can relax, my friend
I can tell you're getting nervous
So do yourself a service
And try to relax my friend
Think of all that we have been through
We'll survive what we get into
I know that you're tired of the war and bloodshed
Tell me, is this how we're supposed to live?
Look at how you grip your sword, enough said
Why should we take when we could give?
You could show a person that you trust them
When you stop and lower your guard
Here we have a chance for some adjustment
Give it a try, it's not that hard
I'm telling you
This life is amazing when you greet it with open arms
Whatever we face, we'll be fine if we're leading from the heart
No matter the place, we can light up the world
Here's how to start:
Greet the world with open arms
Greet the world with open arms
My friend, greet the world with open arms
See? This life is amazing when you greet it with open arms
Whatever we face, we'll be fine if we're leading from the heart
No matter the place, we can light up the world
Here's how to start:
Greet the world with open arms
Greet the world with open arms
Lotus eaters, I'd like to show my friend that kindness is brave
Could you tell me where there's other food to eat?
A cave! You're saying there's a cave where we could feast?
And where do we sail to find this food-filled cave?
Thank you!
This life is amazing when you greet it with open arms
I see in your face, there is so much guilt inside your heart
So why not replace it and light up the world
Here's how to start:
Greet the world with open arms
Greet the world with open arms
You can relax, my friend
Look at all this food, look at all these sheep
I can't believe this cave has all this for us to keep
Captain…
