Ha ha ha
I am the wind, twisting and turning
I give the fire enough to stay burning
Let's play a game
That's what I'm serving
And if you win, you will get what you're yearning
Take a look right here at this bag
It has the winds of the storm all trapped
All you gotta do is not open this bag
Ha ha ha
Keep your friends close and your enemi?s closer
Never r?ally know who you can trust
If they wanna get the bag open, you gotta say "no, sir"
Sometimes killing is a must
'Cause the end always justifies the means
Friends turn into foes and rivalries
So keep your friends close and your enemies closer
Never really know who you can trust (Never really know who you can trust)
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer
Never really know who you can trust
Never really know who you can trust
Now they wanna get the bag open so they can have closure
Sometimes sneaking is a must
Sometimes sneaking is a must
'Cause the end always justifies the means
Everything's changed since Polites, so
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer
Never really know who you can trust
Never really know who you can trust
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer
Never really know who you can trust
Never really know who you can trust
Storm
Full speed ahead
I said to keep the bag closed, but you weren't compliant
If I had to guess? You're heading to the
Land of the giants
