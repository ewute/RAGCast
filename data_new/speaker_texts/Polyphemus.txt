Who are you?
You killed my sheep
My favourit? sheep
What gives you the right to deal a pain so deep
Don't you know that pain you sow is pain you r?ap?
Time to drink
Your blood over where you stand
Your life now is in my hand
Before I'm done
You will learn that it's not so fun to take
You came to my home to steal
But now you'll become my meal
A trade, you see?
Take from you like you took from me
Wine?
Ah, I'd like to thank you
Stranger, what's your name?
Nobody, for your gift I've one to reply
Yes, you shall be the final man to die
Enough
You’ve hurt me enough
Six hundred lives I'll take
Six hundred lives I'll break
And when I kill you then my pain is over
You're dying here and now
Escape is not allowed
You won’t live through this day now die
Die...
It was Nobody, Nobody
Don’t go!
