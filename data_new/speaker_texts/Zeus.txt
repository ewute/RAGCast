A vision of what is to come cannot be outrun, can only be dealt with right here and now
I don't think you're ready
A mission to kill someone's son, a foe who won't run, unlike anyone you have faced before
I don't think you're ready
This is the son of none other than Troy's very own prince Hector, know that he will grow from a boy to an avenger
One fuelled with rage as you're consumed by age
If you don't end him now, you'll have no one left to save
You can say goodbye to
Penelope
You can say goodbye to Penelope
I could raise him as my own (He will burn your house and throne)
Or send him far away from home (He'll find you wherever you go)
Make sure his past is never known (The gods will make it known)
I'd rather bleed for ya, down on my knees for ya (He's bringing you down on your knees for ya)
I'm begging, please
Oh, this is the will of the gods
Please don't make me do this, don't make me do this
The blood on your hands is something you won't lose
Pride is a damsel in distress
Hiding away where only I can undress her
Try all she can not to confess
In the end, it's all the same once I apply all the pressure
Thunder, bring her through the wringer
Show her I'm the judgment call
The one who makes her kingdom fall
Lightning, wield her, use and yield her
Show her what she can't conceal
For true nature will be revealed
Tell me, Odysseus, If I were to make you choose
The lives of your men and crew or your own
Why do I think they'd lose?
Enlighten me, King of Ithaca
Since hunger was far too great
I wonder who'd take the weight of the damned
And suffer a gruesome fate to the
Thunder Bringer, here to ring your
Ears until your deaf with fear and
Spear you while your death is near
Lighting wielder, here to yield your
Time for you have passed your prime
Sublime you for your act of crime
Divine intervention — is that what you seek?
To untie apprehensions that were placed on that Greek?
You are playing with thunder for a man full of shame
But if he's worth the risk of going under
Why not make it a game?
Convince each of them that he ought to be released
And I'll release him
Apollo, Hephaestus
Aphrodite, Ares
H?ra or me
What do you say?
You dare to defy me, to make me feel shame?
No one beats me, no one wins my game
Thunder, bring her through the wringer
Show her I'm the judgment call
The one who makes her kingdom fall
