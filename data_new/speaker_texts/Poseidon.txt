Odysseus of Ithaca
Do you know who I am?
In all my years of living
It isn't very often that I get pissed off
I try to chill with the waves
But damn, you crossed the line
I've been so gracious
And yet, you hurt the son of mine
That's right, the cyclops you made blind, is mine
I'm left without a choice
And without a doubt
Guess the pack of wolves is swimming with the shark now
I've gotta make you bleed
I need to see you drown
But before you go, I need to make you learn how
Ruthlessness is mercy upon ourselves
Ruthl?ssness is mercy upon ourselv?s
Ruthlessness is mercy upon ourselves
Ourselves
You are the worst kind of good
'Cause you're not even great
A Greek who reeks of false righteousness
That's what I hate
'Cause you fight to save lives
But won't kill and don't get the job done
I mean you totally could have avoided all this
Had you just killed my son
But no
You are far too nice
Mercy has a price
It's the final crack, we're about to break the ice now
You reveal your name
Then you let him live
Unlike you I've got no mercy left to give 'cause
Ruthlessness is mercy upon ourselves
Ruthlessness is mercy upon ourselves
Ruthlessness is mercy upon ourselves
Ourselves
And now it is finally time
To say goodbye
Today, you die
Unless, of course, you apologize
For my son's pain
And all his cries
The line between naïveté and
Hopefulness is almost invisible
So close your heart
The world is dark and
Die
Forty three left under your command
I am your darkest moment
The monster that always draws near
Any last words?
What?
Remember me
There you are, coward
I've been waiting for this moment
For the perfect time to strike
When your?home's?so close
And you've?reached your coast
That's when our paths?collide
I've got a reputation
I've got a name to uphold
So I can't go letting you walk or else the world forgets I'm cold
Now get in the water
Get in the water
Or I'll raise the tide so high, all of Ithaca will die
Get in the water
Get in the water
I'll make tidal waves so profound
Both your wife and your son will drown
Get in the water
Get in the water
Don't mistake my threats for bluff
You have lived more than enough
Get in the water
Get in the water
I'll take your son and gouge his eyes
That is, unless you choose to die
Get in the water
No
Ruthlessness is mercy upon ourselves
Die
You idiot
Can't you see?
You sealed your fate just to b?at me
You released my storm when you opened that bag
Blocked your one way home
Now you'll never get back
Or what? You can't kill me
Wait
Wait, ahh
Ugh
How does it feel to be helpless? (Argh)
How does it feel to know pain? (Ugh)
I watched my friends die in horror (Ah-ah)
Crying as they were all slain (Ugh)
I heard their final moments (Argh)
Calling their captain in vain (Ugh)
Look what you turned me into (Ah-ah)
Look what we've become (Ugh, enough)
All of the pain that I've been through (Stop)
Haven't I suffered enough? (Stop)
You didn't stop when I begged you
Told me to close my heart (You)
You said the world was dark (Monster)
Didn't you say that ruthlessness is mercy upon our—
Alright, please
After everything you've done
How will you sleep at night?
