All you can choose is whose
Six hundred men, six hundred men under my command
With only one goal in mind
Make it back alive to our homeland
Six hundred men, six hundred miles of open sea
But the problem's not the distance
It's what lies in between
And Ithaca's waiting Ithaca's waiting
My kingdom is waiting The kingdom is waiting
Penelope's waiting for me
So full speed ahead, full speed ahead
Watch where the birds fly
Watch where the birds fly
They will lead us to land
They will lead us to land
There we'll hunt for food, my second in command
Now full speed ahead, full speed ahead
Give me 'til sunrise, and if we don't return
Then six hundred men can make this whole place burn
Now full speed ahead
Full speed ahead
Full speed ahead
We're up, we're off, and away we go
We're up, we're off, and away we go
Full speed ahead
We're up, we're off, and away we go
We're up, we're off, and a-
Full speed ahead
Then I'll become the
Monster
I will deal the blow
And I'll become the
Monster
Like none they've ever known
So what if I'm the
Monster
Lurking deep below
I must become the
Monster
And then we'll make it home
