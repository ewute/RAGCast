Greet the world with open arms
My friend, greet the world with open arms
See? This life is amazing when you greet it with open arms
I see a light that faintly glows
I'm telling you
You could show a person that you trust them
Give it a try, it's not that hard
A cave! You're saying there's a cave where we could feast?
You and I'll go ahead
Why should we take when we could give?
