I mistook you for a general
One day a boy came for the thrill
With one who's a prisoner far from home
He was betrayed and then imprisoned
'Cause we are the warriors of the mind
I've played your game and won. release him
I see you changing from how I've designed you
And w?'ll make a greater tomorrow, th?n they'll see
But if you make the right decision
To get back to his homestead, he'll make everybody bleed
I'm not looking for a friend
Ohh
Maybe one day they'll follow me and we'll
This way, you can't cross the line
This way, when all is over you'll keep yours and I'll keep mine
Hey!
One day, you might understand
Now, I'm knocking on your door
Ohh
I still intend to make sure you don't fall behind
He's still a threat until he's dead
