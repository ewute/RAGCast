Captain!
Woah
But when we fought this monster, we didn't take a stand
But captain, what'll we do with our fallen friends?
How much longer 'til we all fall down?
For inside the meal, think of your past
Gods, monsters, you know the roster, hostile creatures that we could resist
Don't forget how dangerous the gods are
If you want all the power, you must carry all the blame
She turned our men, the world does not
So let's raid the place and...
And grow snouts and tails, mistakes you'll make
Please don't tell me you're about to do what I think you'll do
Captain, I have something that I must confess
Curse the war, our food store's depleted
But captai
They transformed, this is the price
You miss your wife so bad you trade the lives of your own crew
How much longer 'til the show goes south?
