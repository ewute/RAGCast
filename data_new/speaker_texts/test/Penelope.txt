I’ll make sure that you are safe and sound
Your frame is lighter, your smile torn
They don't know
Though I never thought that it would come to this
That every night
Just keep your eyes open
I would take the suffering from you
The lair of Scylla
And though it was so close to our kingdom
I said I would choose as soon as I weave this shroud
How long has it been?
No matter how long it's been, you're mine
Just know I'll be here buying you time
Just know, I'll be here
Oh, could it be some kind of sign
Once you know that your aim is true
I could take the suffering from you
