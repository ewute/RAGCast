While the boy gets bolder
Here and now
We know these halls, the odds can be tilted
Hold 'em down, hold 'em down
So
Bite, little wolf, bite
Strike, little wolf, strike
Keep your head down, he's aiming for the torches
Die, little wolf, die, little wolf, die
I will not let any part go to waste
You'll have run out of bones to break when you and I are through
Run away before you
No, you don't understand it. This man plans for every fight
Somewhere in the shadows lurks an agile deadly foe
He's using the darkness to hide his approaches
Channel the fire inside your soul and
Time to be the man of the house (Penelope)
