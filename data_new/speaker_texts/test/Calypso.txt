I'm not sorry for loving you
No one can come nor go, my island stays unknown
Now til the end of time
You do?
Or if I came on too strong
Or if I ambushed you
I wish you would chase me
Or if I came on too strong
And if you hate me
You're adorable
I had no friends but the sky and sun
I'm not sorry for loving you
Cause we've got
But I'm not sorry for loving you
And if you hate me
'Cause?you're?all I've ever?known
Hate that I fell in love with you
Why did I fall in love with you?
