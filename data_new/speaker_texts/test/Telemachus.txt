I know life and fate are scary
If I have your strength in me
Or if he's worth the hype but
But I wanna be l-l-l-l-legendary
You're the friend I've never had before
108 old faces of men who call me small
But no clue who you are
If I fight those monsters, is it you I'll find?
Trying to win the heart of my mom
Cause I'm stuck with your stories
Give me sirens and a cyclops
I can't find the words
But boy, I wish I could, so I could bring this world some light
All my life I'd have died to know you
