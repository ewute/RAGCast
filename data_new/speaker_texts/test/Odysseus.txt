I know we'll change the world
Let's cut this charade, you are no wife of mine
There's no time to die
Sirens know about every route and horizon
Why won't you let me?
I'm holding on
Remember them
You don't think I know my own palace?
This way, I’ll close the door
In an instant so we all don't die
Waiting, waiting
Over here!
Would that make us stronger?
Nestor, secure Helen and protect her
Ten years of war, they killed us slowly
Penelope, I’ve told you this before
So much has changed but I'm the same
And made sure we got home again
Find a breach
I need all our hands on his club
Would it keep our foes at bay?
It's almost too perfect, too good to be true
They're growing old, and yet you're still here
I'll go where Poseidon won't reach us
But Scylla has a cost
Everyone grab a harpoon and aim it high
Your families wonder where you've been
Penelope, why?
Odysseus
While on the run from Poseidon
A trade, you see?
Penelope...
Then six hundred men can make this whole place burn
Or send him far away from home (He'll find you wherever you go)
And I will get back to my wife
Storm
Nothing's what it seems
I don't belong here
I can't
If we kill him we'll be stuck inside
If we don't get back safely, my men will turn this place into blazes
At least I know what I'm fighting for
But look at the way this fruit is glowing and filled with glowing seeds
Hide
How am I to get home?
I watched my friends die in horror (Ah-ah)
Why are you here?
And Ithaca's waiting Ithaca's waiting
They wait at the beach
Alright, my brothers, listen closely
So what if I'm the
Great wind god, Aeolus
Use your swords to sharpen the stub
You know that I pr?fer my feet on the ground
This way, you won't waste my time
Here and they wound up at your door
Cut off their tails! We're ending this now
I don't know if you know this
Don't let him get close, he's strong but he's slow
Athena!
NO
Our fates are intertwined, they're attached
Scanning for information
Is it nature or divine
Now I know how to get back to my island
Selfish and prid?ful and vain
Storm
But now we're done
That's not a teaching of mine
Oh, bring it on
There's something wrong here
If your plan's so great then why'd you wait to say it?
Whatever you need to say can wait some more
I don't mean to tip your scale but
Oh, you better run or soon you will be done for
And our comrades will not die in vain
But all of that was to bring me back to you
Thank you for the concern but brother I can assure you
Row for your lives!
We're gonna shoot for the sky
I keep thinking of the infant from that night
What your world has been
This is the home of the wind god
Think of your wives and your children
You can be hurt or you can beat her
I lost my best friend
Poseidon, we meant no harm
You first, and maybe I'll do the same
We gotta stab him in the eye
Waiting, waiting (Penelope)
Til I'm in the clear, til I'm out of here, oh
But now we'll be the ones who slay
Everybody listen closely
Monster
For the fallen and afraid
Six hundred friends are waiting for us to show our faces
If I became the
I'm not dying here, I'm still fighting here
Deep down I would trade the world to see my son and wife
So now there is no turning back
I realised nearby, there were sirens
Teucer will shoot any ambush attack
We're up, we're off, and away we go (Full speed ahead)
Eurylochus, go make sure this island is secure
Every time I caved to guilt?
The rest of our fleet
We're the ones who carry on
Hermes?
Til I see it through, til I've beaten you
'Cause we are the warriors of the mind
And my real wife knows I don't have a daughter
I still believe in goodness
When does a man become a monster? Forgive me
Okay
That's how it's supposed to be
Didn't you say that ruthlessness is mercy upon our—
Since you claim you're so much wiser
As many as you can find
Oh, for you, I would die, but can't you let me stay dry?
It's been 8 years, how long will this go?
Diomedes will lead the charge
No!
Who was that?
I'm so glad we see eye to eye
So full speed ahead, full speed ahead
We're shooting for the island in the sky
In the sky
Penelope...
All I hear are screams, every time I dare to close my eyes
How did suffering become so endless?
I see fire but there's no smoke
My friend is dead, our foe is blind
500 men gone, this can't go on
Trying to make it home with no storm or tidal wave
Waiting, oh
I fight for us, I fight for us
I am not the man you knew
You're goin' to call off that storm
This way, you can't cross the line
Unmatched, witty, and queen of
Make sure his past is never known (The gods will make it known)
For you
I'm not sure I follow
Mistakes I ever mak?? Don't break when
