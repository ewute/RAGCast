Storm
It's what lies in between
Show him that we're deadly, ha, ha
Tonight, we make the Trojans pay
Full speed ahead
It's just one life to take
And when we kill him then our journey’s over
Odysseus
They will lead us to land
He is the man-made monster
Six hundred men Six hundred men
Defeat is not allowed
Our lives like this when people die like this?
And Little Ajax will stay back
Our foe must be thwarted right here and now
So captain, what's the plan?
We are the ones who conquer
Push forward
Full speed ahead, until we find the prophet
Ruthlessness is (Captain) mercy upon our- Captain
Diomedes will lead the charge
You are a threat no longer
Storm, storm
Watch where the birds fly
We're up, we're off, and a-
When the fire begins to fade
Six hundred lives at stake
Nothing's what it seems
Brace for a storm
Storm
Monster
Don't let him get close, he's strong but he's slow
Make it back alive to our homeland
Let's kill him!
Think of your wives and your children
Six hundred reasons to take what we can
