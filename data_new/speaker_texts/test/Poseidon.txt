Don't mistake my threats for bluff
I mean you totally could have avoided all this
A Greek who reeks of false righteousness
Look what we've become (Ugh, enough)
Crying as they were all slain (Ugh)
You are the worst kind of good
Get in the water
Get in the water
To say goodbye
Mercy has a price
Then you let him live
Alright, please
Do you know who I am?
How does it feel to know pain? (Ugh)
Get in the water
Wait, ahh
Hopefulness is almost invisible
How does it feel to be helpless? (Argh)
That is, unless you choose to die
You reveal your name
What?
You sealed your fate just to b?at me
