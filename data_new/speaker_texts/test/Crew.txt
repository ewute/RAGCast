But when does a comet become a meteor?
When does a man become a monster? Forgive me
Deep down I would trade the world to see my son and wife
Full speed ahead
Storm
Wh?n does a man become a monster?
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer
Captain, how much longer til your luck runs out?
You're as old as he was when I left for war
How much longer 'til the show goes south?
Every man I’ve slain?
