Deep in the night, the fight lasts for hours
I'm not sorry for loving you
Why did I fall in love with you?
Or if I ambushed you
Penelope (Ah, oh)
I know you're a goddess
One fuelled with rage as you're consumed by age
I'm not sorry for loving you
This is my goodbye
The best strategies we've seen
You can be hurt or you can beat her
Wouldn't you like to use more than words?
Unmatched, witty, and queen of
Six hundred men (Six hundred)
Ohh
I hate that I fell in love with you
Nah, don't be modest
How am I supposed to get over you?
Wouldn't you like your outcome preferred?
I'm not sorry for loving you
Then I am sorry my love's too much for you
Or if I came on too strong
