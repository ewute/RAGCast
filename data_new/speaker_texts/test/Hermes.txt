(Oh) Wouldn't you like to have some of the magic?
Here in the root of this flower
When strangers lurk around the isle
You'll need a mindset change for this
(Oh) Deep in the night, the fight can be tragic
All you need's imagination
You wanna get home?
That'll grind you to the bones
First stop, uncharted waters
(Oh) Wouldn't you like a taste of the power?
You can be hurt or you can beat her
Put it all on the line
A foe like Circe's not to be messed with
Divine intervention
I must say, what a brilliant speech you gave
You'll need the blessing of a certain god
When you take her on alone
You think you're going, you keep on rowing
Ahahahahaha, hello old friend
