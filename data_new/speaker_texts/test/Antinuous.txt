Bite, little wolf, bite
Channel the fire inside your soul
Die, little wolf, die, little wolf, die
Stop us from taking her love and more
Then, when he docks his ship, we can breach it
Hold us down
Screw this?damn challenge, no more delays
Cut him down into tiny pieces
Hold him down 'til the boy stops shaking
Fight, little wolf, fight
Try, little wolf try
Hold 'em down, hold 'em down
You'll have run out of bones to break when you and I are through
Here and now, there's a chance for action
While the boy gets bolder
While the throne gets colder
There's a chance for action
