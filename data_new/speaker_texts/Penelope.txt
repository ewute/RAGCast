Just keep your eyes open
Just keep your eyes open
Just keep your eyes open
Just keep your eyes open
Wake up!
Wake up, Odysseus, they're opening the bag
Wake up!
Don’t you miss me?
Then jump in the water and kiss me
I’ll make sure that you are safe and sound
Come play with me and our daughter and let’s watch our love leave the ground
I would take the suffering from you
I could take the suffering from you
I will take the suffering from you
Of course!
Oh no!
He will chase you high and low
So find a place he’d never go
The one way you'll get home
Is sailing where he's scared to roam, oh
It’s through the lair of Scylla
This is your only way home
The lair of Scylla
Well, you asked and now you know
Now jump in the water!
I would take the suffering from you
I could take the suffering from you
I will take the suffering from you
I'm supposed to choose a suitor to wear the crown
I said I would choose as soon as I weave this shroud
They don't know
That every night
I unthread all the work I've done
Cause I'd rather lie Than allow them to think they've won
Though I never thought I would resort to this
Just know I'll be here
Though I don't know how much longer I'll last
Since we saw that storm
And though it was so close to our kingdom
It was far from the norm
Unless
Oh, could it be some kind of sign
That my world is all about to change?
Is it finally time for the challenge I arranged?
Though I never thought that it would come to this
Just know I'll be here buying you time
Oh! Buying you time
Whoever can string my husband's old bow
And shoot through 12 axes cleanly
Will be the new king, sit down at the throne
And rule with me as their queen
Let the arrow fly
Once you know that your aim is true
Cause I'd rather die than grow old without the best of you
Though I never thought that these would be the lengths we'd go for love
I would not have it any other way
And though I never thought that it would end like this
Just know, I'll be here
Waiting, waiting
Waiting, waiting
Waiting, waiting
Oh
Is it you? Have my prayers been answered?
Is it really you standing there, or am I dreaming once more?
You look different, your eyes look tired
Your frame is lighter, your smile torn
Is it really you, my love?
What kinds of things did you do?
If that's true, could you do me a favor?
Just a moment of labor that would bring me some peace
See that wedding bed? Could you carry it over?
Lift it high on your shoulders and take it far away from here
Only my husband knew that
So I guess that makes him you
I will fall in love with you over and over again
I don't care how, where, or when
No matter how long it's been, you're mine
Don't tell me you're not the same person
You're always my husband, and I've been waiting, waiting
Waiting, waiting (Penelope)
Waiting, waiting
Waiting, oh
For you
How long has it been?
I love you
I love you
