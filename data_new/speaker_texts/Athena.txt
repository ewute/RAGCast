Have you forgotten the lessons I taught you?
Have you forgotten to turn off your heart? This is not you
I see you changing from how I've designed you
Have you forgotten your purpose? Let me remind you
Goddess of wisdom, master of war
My life has one mission, create the greatest warrior
I had a challenge, a test of skill
A magic boar only the best could kill
One day a boy came for the thrill
A boy whose mind rivalled the boar's own will
Maybe one day he'll follow me
And w?'ll make a greater tomorrow, th?n they'll see
I know he'll change the world
'Cause he is a warrior of the mind
Maybe one day I'll reach him
And we can build his skills as I teach him
If there's a problem, he'll have the answer
He is a warrior of the mind
How can you see through my spell?
Well done, enlighten me, what's your name?
Nice try, but two can play this game
If you're looking for a mentor, I'll make sure your time's well spent
We'll see where it ends
Maybe one day they'll follow me and we'll
Make a greater tomorrow, then they'll see
I know we'll change the world
'Cause we are the warriors of the mind
Maybe one day we'll reach them
And we can build their skills as we teach them
If there's a problem, we'll have the answer
We are the warriors of the mind
I still intend to make sure you don't fall behind
Don't forget that you're a warrior of a very special kind
You are a warrior of the mind
Don't disappoint me
Have you forgotten the lessons I taught you?
He's still a threat until he's dead
Finish it
No?
Don't!
You were reckless, sentimental at best
That's not a teaching of mine
You’ve grown soft, your dead friends can attest
Hey!
Put your emotions aside
You're a warrior meant to lead the rest
I don't know where I went wrong
But I warned ya’, and you failed the test
So now I'm gone
This way, you'll know what your place is
This way, you can't cross the line
This way, when all is over you'll keep yours and I'll keep mine
This way, you won't disappoint me
This way, you won't waste my time
This way, I’ll close the door
Consider this as my goodbye
You're not looking for a mentor
I'm not looking for a friend
I mistook you for a general
What a waste of effort spent
One day, you'll hear what I'm saying
One day, you might understand
One day, but not today, for after all you're
This day, you sever your own head
This day, you cut the line
This day, you lost it all
Consider this as my goodbye
Ohh
Consider this as my goodbye
Ohh
This is my goodbye
Ohh
Consider this as my goodbye
Ohh
This is my goodbye
Father, God King, rarely do I ask for favors
Now, I'm knocking on your door
With hopes to save a friendship
With one who's a prisoner far from home
Odysseus
Who's them?
Bring it!
They were trying to do him worse
All he did was reimburse them
Now they'll tread with caution first
To live another day and sing another verse
Did you forget they failed to listen?
He was betrayed and then imprisoned
But if you make the right decision
He can still build a future with those who miss him
He was busy fighting
Wait
Please reconsider this
Ares
Hold your tongue now, his son's my friend
And tell your lover that a broken heart can mend
Do you want more bloodshed? Then set him free
To get back to his homestead, he'll make everybody bleed
He's got the mind of a genius
He's pretty skilled with words
He's kind of funny
Never once has he cheated on his wife
I've played your game and won. release him
Let him go, please
Let him go
