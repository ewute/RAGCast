This is the son of none other than Troy's very own prince Hector, know that he will grow from a boy to an avenger
One fuelled with rage as you're consumed by age
If you don't end him now, you'll have no one left to save
You can say goodbye to
Penelope
You can say goodbye to Penelope
Nah, don't be modest
I know you're a goddess
So let's be honest
You are Athena (Athena)
Badass in the arena
Unmatched, witty, and queen of
The best strategies we've seen
Po-ly-phe-mus
Po-ly-phe-mus
Po-ly-phe-mus
Just a man
This day, you sever your own head
This day, you cut the line
This day, you lost it all
Consider this as my goodbye
Ohh
Consider this as my goodbye
Ohh
This is my goodbye
Ohh
Consider this as my goodbye
Ohh
This is my goodbye
Just keep your eyes open
When does a ripple become a tidal wave?
When does a man become a monster?
Wouldn't you like a taste of the power?
Wouldn't you like to use more than words?
Deep in the night, the fight lasts for hours
You can be hurt or you can beat her
Wouldn't you like to have some of the magic?
Wouldn't you like your outcome preferred?
Deep in the night, the fight can be tragic
I'll help you conquer her
Wouldn't you like a taste of the power?
Wouldn't you like to use more than words?
Deep in the night, the fight lasts for hours
You can be hurt or you can beat her
Wouldn't you like to have some of the magic?
Wouldn't you like your outcome preferred?
Deep in the night, the fight can be tragic
I'll help you conquer her
(Oh) Wouldn't you like a taste of the power?
Wouldn't you like to use more than words?

I'll help you conquer her
Penelope (Ah, oh)
Penelope (Ah, oh)
Apollo
Hephaestus
Aphrodite
Ares, Ares
Hera
Thunder, bring her through the wringer
Show her I'm the judgment call
The one who makes her kingdom fall
But I'm not sorry for loving you
I'm not sorry for loving you
I'm not sorry for loving you
I'm not sorry for loving you
So if I pushed you
So if I pushed you
Or if I came on too strong
Or if I came on too strong
Or if I ambushed you
Or if I ambushed you
For that, I'll say I was wrong
For that, I'll say I was wrong
And if you hate me
And if you hate me
Then I am sorry my love's too much for you
Then I am sorry my love's too much for you

I hate that I fell in love with you
Hate that I fell in love with you
Why did I fall in love with you?
Why did I fall in love with you?
What do I do with this love for you?
What do I do with this love for you?
How am I supposed to get over you?
How am I supposed to get over you?
Why in the world won't you love me too?
