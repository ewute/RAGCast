I must say, what a brilliant speech you gave
Just a friend who could help you save your men
A foe like Circe's not to be messed with
You want to beat her?
You'll need the blessing of a certain god
Divine intervention
Someone who's not afraid to send a message
Wouldn't you like a taste of the power?
Wouldn't you like to use more than words?
Deep in the night, the fight lasts for hours
You can be hurt or you can beat her
Wouldn't you like to hav? some of the magic?
Wouldn't you like your outcom? preferred?
Deep in the night, the fight can be tragic
I'll help you conquer her
She can turn you to an animal
That'll end up on her plate
She can all but make you fall in love
Like you're on your hundredth date
She can conjure up a monster
That'll grind you to the bones
She has all the ways to haunt ya
When you take her on alone
Wouldn't you like a taste of the power?
Wouldn't you like to use more than words?
Deep in the night, the fight lasts for hours
You can be hurt or you can beat her
Wouldn't you like to have some of the magic?
Wouldn't you like your outcome preferred?
Deep in the night, the fight can be tragic
I'll help you conquer her
Oh-oh
Here in the root of this flower
There lies such a power to take her on
You must consume and digest it
Then you'll manifest a being of your creation
All you need's imagination
Though it's only for a moment
Till you've beaten your opponent
And I call this root "holy moly"
Wouldn't you like a taste of the power?
Wouldn't you like to use more than words?
Deep in the night, the fight lasts for hours
You can be hurt or you can beat her
Wouldn't you like to have some of the magic?
Wouldn't you like your outcome preferred?
Deep in the night, the fight can be tragic
I'll help you conquer her
(Oh) Wouldn't you like a taste of the power?
Wouldn't you like to use more than words?
(Oh) Deep in the night, the fight lasts for hours
You can be hurt or you can beat her
(Oh) Wouldn't you like to have some of the magic?
Wouldn't you like your outcome preferred?
(Oh) Deep in the night, the fight can be tragic
I'll help you conquer her
Don't thank me, friend, you very well may die
Mh-hm-hm, good luck
Ahahahahaha, hello old friend
You're being given a final option
Consider this your one last chance
To make it back home and abandon caution
Wash it away like the blood your hands have known
I know if you dance with fate
Then I know, I know you'll enhance your state
Well it's a little bit dangerous, my friend
You'll need a mindset change for this
You cannot get away with playing safe for this
You wanna get home?
Put it all on the line
And put your whol? brain in it
Remember ?very trick in your domain for this
You gotta treat it like it is the main event
You wanna get home?
Put it all on the line
Be dangerous
First stop, uncharted waters
When lost, look towards the sky
Follow the north star, no matter how far
You think you're going, you keep on rowing
When strangers lurk around the isle
When danger greets you with a smile
Fight your way through, do what you must do
But no matter what, keep moving
It's gonna be dangerous, my friend
You'll need a mindset change for this
You cannot get away with playing safe for this
You wanna get home?
Put it all on the line
And put your whole brain in it
Remember every trick in your domain for this
You gotta treat it like it is the main event
You wanna get home?
Put it all on the line
Be dangerous
