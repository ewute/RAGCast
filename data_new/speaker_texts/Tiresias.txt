I am the prophet with the answers you seek
Time, I've unlocked it
I see past and future running free
There is a world where I help you get home
But that's not a world I know
I see a song of past romance
I see the sacrifice of man
I see portrayals of betrayals
And a brother's final stand
I see you on the brink of death
I see you draw your final breath
I see a man who gets to make it home alive
But it's no longer you
