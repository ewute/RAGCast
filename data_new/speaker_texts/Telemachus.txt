Just keep your eyes open
Just keep your eyes open
Just keep your eyes open
Just keep your eyes open
It's just me, myself, and I
Stuck in my bedroom, living in this world you left behind
Dreaming of all these monsters that I'll never get to fight
But boy, I wish I could, so I could bring this world some light
Cause I'm stuck with your stories
But no clue who you are
And no idea if you're dead or just too far
Somebody tell me, come and give me a sign
If I fight those monsters, is it you I'll find?
If so, then
Give me sirens and a cyclops
Give me giants and a hydra
I know life and fate are scary
But I wanna be legendary
I'll fight the harpies and chimeras
The minotaurs, even Cerberus
I know life and fate are scary
But I wanna be l-l-l-l-legendary
There are strangers in our halls
Trying to win the heart of my mom
But she is standing tall
108 old faces of men who call me small
They keep taking space and it's not much longer we can stall
Cause they're getting impatient, dangerous too
And I would fight them if I was half as strong as you
Somebody help me, come and give me the strength
Can I do whatever it takes to keep my mom safe?
If so, then
Give me sirens and a cyclops
Give me giants and a hydra
I know life and fate are scary
But I wanna be legendary
I'll fight the harpies and chimeras
The minotaurs, even Cerberus
I know life and fate are scary
But I wanna be legendary
I don't know who this friend is
Or if he's worth the hype but
My time with you has been splendid
The best day of my life
Cause I got in a fight, sailed to an island
When I've never left home shores
You're the friend I've never had before
And so I think maybe, if life wasn't spent as planned
Maybe, it's time that you lend a hand
I don't think he'll mind
If not his friend then mine
Father?
All my life, I'd have died to meet you
Thought about your name so much it hurts
For twenty years I'd dreamt of how I'd greet you
Oh, and now you're here
I can't find the words
All my life I'd have died to know you
Days and nights I wish that I could show you
For twenty years I never could outgrow you
Oh, and now you're here
I can't help but wonder
What your world must be
If we're like each other
If I have your strength in me
I can't help but feel like
Sorrow's all I've known
And I can't help but realize
For so long I've felt alone
