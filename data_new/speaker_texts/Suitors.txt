Fight, little wolf, fight
Wanna entertain me?
Bite, little wolf, bite
Let's see how you take this
Strike, little wolf, strike
Wanna be a man? Then
Fight, little wolf, fight, little wolf, fight
You've made your worst mistake here, might be your last one too
You'll have run out of bones to break when you and I are through
I'll teach you all the lessons your daddy never could
This cruel world doesn't give out presents just for being good
So
Fight, little wolf, fight
Wanna entertain m??
Bite, little wolf, bite
L?t's see how you take this
Strike, little wolf, strike
Wanna be a man? Then
Fight, little wolf, fight, little wolf, fight
Or die, little wolf, die
Don't you know it's fight or
Fly, little wolf, fly
All because you had to
Try, little wolf try
Run away before you
Die, little wolf, die, little wolf, die
Time is fleeting, it's running out
Time to be the man of the house (Penelope)
Time is fleeting, it's running out
Time to be the man of the house (Penelope)
Penelope
Penelope
Hold us down while the throne gets colder
Hold us down while we slowly age
Hold us down while the boy gets bolder
Where the hell is our pride and our rage?
Here and now, there's a chance for action
Here and now, we can take control
Here and now, burn it down to ashes
Channel the fire inside your soul
Hold us down
While the throne gets colder
Hold us down
While we slowly age
Hold us down
While the boy gets bolder
Where the hell is our pride and our rage?
Here and now
There's a chance for action
Here and now
We can take control
Here and now
Burn it down to ashes
Channel the fire inside your soul
Hold him down 'til the boy stops shaking
Hold him down while I slit his throat
Hold him down while I slowly break his pride, his trust, his faith, and his bones
Cut him down into tiny pieces
Throw him down in the great below
When the crown wonders where the prince is
Only the ocean and I will know
And then we'll
Hold her down while her gate is open
Hold her down while I get a taste
Hold her down while we share her spoils
I will not let any part go to waste
Here and now, there's a chance for action
Here and now, we can take control
Here and now, burn it down to ashes
Channel the fire inside your soul and
Hold 'em down, hold 'em down
Hold 'em down, hold 'em down
In the heat of battle at the edge of the unknown
Somewhere in the shadows lurks an agile deadly foe
We have the advantage, we've the numbers and the might
No, you don't understand it. This man plans for every fight
Where is he? Where is he?
Keep your head down, he's aiming for the torches
Our weapons, they're missing!
He's using the darkness to hide his approaches
We're empty handed up against an archer
Our only chance is to strike him in the darkness
We know these halls, the odds can be tilted
