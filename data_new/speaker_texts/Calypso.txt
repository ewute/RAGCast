Morning sleepyhead
You've been resting for a while
I swore that you were dead
When you washed up on my isle
Did you know you talk in your sleep?
Tell me, though, who's Penelope?
Anyways, I've got all you could want here
All you could need here
Just you and me, my dear my love for life
Soon into bed we'll climb and spend our time
I'm what you want here
I'm what you need here
Just you and me, my love in paradise
Now til the end of time
From here on out, you're mine, all mine
Oh handsome, you may try
But last I checked, goddesses can't die
You're adorable
Bow down now to the immortal Calypso, here to entertain
But fear not, I bring no pain
Cause we've got
All we could want here
All we could need here
Under my spell, we're stuck in paradise
No one can come nor go, my island stays unknown
You're mine, all mine
Someone arrived today
They said they're taking you away
That you're not mine to save
And soon I won't get to see your face
So I came by to say
You're unlike anyone I have ever?known
'Cause?you're?all I've ever?known
And if I?pushed you
Or if I came on too strong
Or if I ambushed you
For that, I'll say I was wrong
And if you hate me
Then I am sorry my love's too much for you
But I'm not sorry for loving you
I'm not sorry for loving you
I'm not sorry for loving you
I'm not sorry for loving you
Let me speak
I spent my whole life here
Was cast away when I was young
Alone for a hundred years
I had no friends but the sky and sun
So when you washed ashore
I thought for sure that you were my dream come true
I thought I knew
So if I pushed you
So if I pushed you
Or if I came on too strong
Or if I came on too strong
Or if I ambushed you
Or if I ambushed you
For that, I'll say I was wrong
For that, I'll say I was wrong
And if you hate me
And if you hate me
Then I am sorry my love's too much for you
Then I am sorry my love's too much for you
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
But I'm not sorry for loving you
But I'm not sorry for loving you
I'm not sorry for loving you
I'm not sorry for loving you
I'm not sorry for loving you
I'm not sorry for loving you
I'm not sorry for loving you
I'm not sorry for loving you
I'm not sorry
I'm angry and tired and restless and sad
I'm stuck in the moments I swore that we had
I wish you would chase me
Or try to embrace me
For once, I wish you would lie and say
You do?
I hate that I fell in love with you
Hate that I fell in love with you
Why did I fall in love with you?
Why did I fall in love with you?
What do I do with this love for you?
What do I do with this love for you?
How am I supposed to get over you?
How am I supposed to get over you?
Why in the world won't you love me too?
