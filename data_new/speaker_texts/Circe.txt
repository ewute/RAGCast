Come inside
Welcome to the best part of your lives
Go ahead and rest wherever you like
I got you, don't worry Circe's got you now
Take a seat
Let me bring you all something to eat
I bet you're tired from the years spent on your feet
I got you, don't worry Circe's got you now
For inside the meal, think of your past
She had cast a spell, and your mistakes
They began to squeal, they'll be the last
And grow snouts and tails, mistakes you'll make
She changed them
I got all the power, yeah, I got all the power
No, I'm not a player, I'm a puppeteer
No, I don't play, I puppeteer, yeah
They transformed, this is the price
And it wasn't quick, we pay to live
She turned our men, the world does not
From men to pigs, tend to forgive
She changed them
I got all the power, yeah, I got all the power
No, I'm not a player, I'm a puppeteer
No, I don't play, I puppeteer, yeah
Who, me?
All I did was reveal their true forms
Huh
I don't know who you are nor why you're here
But let me make this one thing clear
I've got people to protect
Nymphs I can't n?glect
So I'm not taking chances, dear
If you mak? one wrong move, then you're done for
Anything I don't approve, then you're done for
I could put a spell on you and you're done for
Boy, you better run or soon you will done for
You must be a liar
Mortals can't acquire
Moly without dire consequence
Hermes gave it to you, didn't he?
I've got people to protect, friends I can't neglect
So now there is no turning back
You've made your one wrong move, now you're done for
I will be the one to prove that you're done for
Not even a spell saves you, cause you're done for
Oh, you better run or soon you will be done for
My nymphs are like my daughters
I protect them at all costs
The last time we let strangers live
We faced a heavy loss
You've given me no reason to
Bestow you with my trust
But everyone's true colours are
Revealed in acts of lust
There are other ways of persuasion
There are other modes of control
There are other means of deceit
There are other roads to the soul
There are other actions of passion
You have so much left to learn
Want to save your men from the fire?
Show me that you're willing to burn, woah
Who's to say, with the mistakes I've made, Don't be afraid
That they will be th? last Think of your past
Mistakes I ever mak?? Don't break when
There is so much power, so much power
But there's no puppet here, here
This is the price we pay to love, I'm just a man
There is no line never enough, I'm just a man
So much power, so much power, forgive me
But there's no puppet here
