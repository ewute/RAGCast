Alright, my brothers, listen closely
Tonight, we make the Trojans pay
Ten years of war, they killed us slowly
But now we'll be the ones who slay
Think of your wives and your children
Your families wonder where you've been
They're growing old, and yet you're still here
Do what I say and you'll see them again
Yes sir!
Diomedes will lead the charge
Agamemnon will flank the guards
Menelaus will let our mates through the gates to take the whole city at large
Teucer will shoot any ambush attack
And Little Ajax will stay back
Nestor, secure Helen and protect her
Neo, avenge your father, kill the brothers of Hector!
Find that inner strength now
Use that well of pride
Fight through every pain now
Ask yourself inside
What do you live for?
What do you try for?
What do you wish for?
What do you fight for?
Penelope...
Penelope...
And Telemachus
I fight for us, I fight for us
Penelope
Telemachus
I'm on my way
Attack!
Aargh
Who was that?
Tell me how
Say no more, I know that I'm ready
It's just an infant, it's just a boy, what sort of imminent threat does he pose that I cannot avoid?
I could raise him as my own (He will burn your house and throne)
Or send him far away from home (He'll find you wherever you go)
Make sure his past is never known (The gods will make it known)
I'd rather bleed for ya, down on my knees for ya (He's bringing you down on your knees for ya)
I'm begging, please
Oh, this is the will of the gods
Please don't make me do this, don't make me do this
I look into your eyes and I
Think back to the son of mine
You're as old as he was when I left for war
Will these actions haunt my days
Every man I’ve slain?
Is the price I pay endless pain?
Close your eyes and spare yourself the view
How could I hurt you??
I'm just a man who's trying to go home
Even after all the years away from what I’ve known
I'm just a man who's fighting for his life
Deep down I would trade the world to see my son and wife
I'm just a man
But when does a comet become a meteor?
When does a candl? become a blaze?
Wh?n does a man become a monster?
When does a ripple become a tidal wave?
When does the reason become the blame?
When does a man become a monster?
When does a comet become a meteor?
When does a candle become a blaze? Forgive me
When does a man become a monster? Forgive me
When does a man become a monster? Forgive me
I'm just a man
Six hundred men, six hundred men under my command
With only one goal in mind
Make it back alive to our homeland
Six hundred men, six hundred miles of open sea
But the problem's not the distance
It's what lies in between
And Ithaca's waiting Ithaca's waiting
My kingdom is waiting The kingdom is waiting
Penelope's waiting for me
So full speed ahead, full speed ahead
Watch where the birds fly
Watch where the birds fly
They will lead us to land
They will lead us to land
There we'll hunt for food, my second in command
Now full speed ahead, full speed ahead
We're up, we're off, and away we go
We're up, we're off, and away we go (Full speed ahead)
We're up, we're off, and away we go
Polites!
Something feels off here
I see fire but there's no smoke
No
Polites gear up, you and I'll go ahead
We should try to find a way no one ends up dead
Give me 'til sunrise, and if we don't return
Then six hundred men can make this whole place burn
Now full speed ahead
Full speed ahead
Full speed ahead
We're up, we're off, and away we go
We're up, we're off, and away we go
Full speed ahead
We're up, we're off, and away we go
We're up, we're off, and a-
Full speed ahead
Huh?
I'm fine, Polites
Stay back
We're only here for food
Six hundred friends are waiting for us to show our faces
Stay back, I'm warning you
If we don't get back safely, my men will turn this place into blazes
My friend, I wish that I could say that I agree
But look at the way this fruit is glowing and filled with glowing seeds
It took me a while to notice just what kind of fruit they eat
It's a lotus, it controls your mind and never lets you free
That's what we'd get with open arms
Greet the world with open arms
Athena!
Let's go!
Show yourself
I know you're watching me
Show yourself
I can see you
Haha! I was lying and you fell for my bluff
Hahahaha
You first, and maybe I'll do the same
Nah, don't be modest
I know you're a goddess
So let's be honest
You are Athena (Athena)
Badass in the arena
Unmatched, witty, and queen of
The best strategies we've seen
Sounds like a plan
Goddess and man
Bestest of friends
Okay
Make a greater tomorrow, then they'll see
I know we'll change the world
'Cause we are the warriors of the mind
Maybe one day we'll reach them
And we can build their skills as we teach them
If there's a problem, we'll have the answer
We are the warriors of the mind
Over here!
It's almost too perfect, too good to be true
Why would the lotus eaters pass up on all this food?
Hey there
We're just travellers
We come in peace
There's been a misunderstanding
We never came here to steal
But now that I see we've done some damage
Maybe you and I can make a deal
I'll give you our finest treasure
So long as we leave alive
You can keep the world's best tasting wine
Have a drink
One sip and you'll understand
The power that's in your hands
A wine so fresh
You'd never wanna eat human flesh again
Then we shall be on our way
No bloodshed in here today
A trade, you see?
A gift from you and a gift from me
My name is Nobody, Nobody, Nobody
I'm so glad we see eye to eye
What?
Watch out!
My brothers
The rest of our fleet
They wait at the beach
And if we're defeated, they’re good as dead
Straight ahead, that is who we're fighting
No backup, no chance for support
So draw out your swords
Our foe must be thwarted right here and now
Show me how great is your will to survive
Six hundred lives at stake
It's just one life to take
And when we kill him then our journey’s over
No dying on me now
Defeat is not allowed
We must live through this day so
Fight, fight, fight
Surround him, surround him
Attack from behind, keep distance in mind
And stay in his blindspot and strike his heels, strike the heels
Show him that we're deadly, ha, ha
Exhaust him, exhaust him
Don't let him get close, he's strong but he's slow
He can't land a blow if we're out of reach
Find a breach
Stand up and fight for your lives
Six hundred lives at stake
It's just one life to take
And when we kill him then our journey’s over
Push forward
No dying on us now
Defeat is not allowed
We must live through this day so
Fight, fight, fight
We must move quickly, we don't have much time
He didn't notice I mixed lotus in his wine
Mark my words now, this is not the end
Remember them
Remember them
When the fire begins to fade
When the fire begins to fade
For the fallen and afraid
For the fallen and afraid
We are not to let them die in vain
We are not to let them die in vain
Remember them
Remember them
We're the ones who carry on
We're the ones who carry on
The flames of those who've gone
The flames of those who've gone
And our comrades will not die in vain
And our comrades will not die in vain
I need all our hands on his club
This is how we're getting out of here
Use your swords to sharpen the stub
And turn it to a giant spear
His body is blocking the path
If we kill him we'll be stuck inside
We gotta stab him in the eye
Remember them
We're the ones who carry on
The flames of those who've gone
And our comrades will not die in vain
Now!
Scatter!
Hide
Wait
Wait
Let's grab the sheep and away we go
No
What good would killing do
When mercy is a skill more of this world could learn to use
My friend is dead, our foe is blind
The blood we shed, it never dries
Is this what it means to be a warrior of the mind?
Hey, Cyclops!
When we met, I led with peace
While you fed your inner beast
But my comrades will not die in vain
Remember them
The next time that you dare choose not to spare
Remember them
Remember us
Remember me
I'm the reigning king of Ithaca
I am neither man nor mythical
I am your darkest moment
I am the infamous
Odysseus
You were reckless, sentimental at best
That's not a teaching of mine
You’ve grown soft, your dead friends can attest
Hey!
Put your emotions aside
You're a warrior meant to lead the rest
I don't know where I went wrong
But I warned ya’, and you failed the test
So now I'm gone
This way, you'll know what your place is
This way, you can't cross the line
This way, when all is over you'll keep yours and I'll keep mine
This way, you won't disappoint me
This way, you won't waste my time
This way, I’ll close the door
Consider this as my goodbye
That’s just lik? you, why should I be surprised?
Selfish and prid?ful and vain
Unlike you, every time someone dies
I'm left to deal with the strain
What’s a title that a goddess could lend if I'll never sleep at night?
I'll remind you I saw you as a friend
But now we're done
This way, you’re out of my head now
This way, you won't plague my life
This way, when all is done, you're out of sight and out of mind
This way, you get what you wanted
This way, you can save your time
This way, you close the door and have your damn goodbye
At least I know what I'm fighting for
While you're fighting to be known
Since you claim you're so much wiser
Why's your life spent all alone?
You're alone
These waves and tides
Have grown in strength and size
Is it nature or divine
Or a blessing in disguise?
Our home's in sight
This storm's our final fight
There's no time to die
Comrades?
Brace for a storm
Storm
The likes of which we've never seen before
Brace for a storm
Storm
With home so close, we must keep pushing forward
Full speed ahead
Head towards the island but avoid the crashing waves
Tread where the tide is flat and then you will be saf?
Have them follow my ship, I'll ensure that we prevail
Storm
Storm
We'll beat this storm
Storm
An island in the sky
Eurylochus, grab the harpoons
As many as you can find
We're gonna shoot for the sky
Everyone grab a harpoon and aim it high
We're shooting for the island in the sky
In the sky
You've heard the?legends?of the island?in the sky, this proves they're?true
We're in the home of the wind god
How many floating islands have you seen before?
This is the home of the wind god
I'm gonna climb to the top and ask 'em for a hand
Have faith, friend, we've come this far
I still believe in goodness
I still believe that we could be kind
Lead from the heart, and see what starts
Where is this coming from, my friend?
And suddenly you doubt that I could figure this out?
Thank you for the concern but brother I can assure you
Our journey is almost done
I understand that we're tired
I understand that we're fazed
But don't forget how much we've already faced
I took six hundred men to war and not one of them died there
In case you needed a reminder
If you'd like to speak more, let me pull you aside then
I need to talk to you in private
I can't have you planting seeds of doubt
I can't have you disagreeing each route
I need you to always be devout and comply with this
Or we'll all die in this
Okay?
Thank you
Great wind god, Aeolus
I don't know if you know this
But our path to home is blocked by an impenetrable storm
I ask for your assistance
So we at last can go the distance
Can you cast the perfect winds for us and aid our journey home?
A game?
Deal
Sounds too easy, what's the catch?
What?
Something dangerous, friends
We mustn't lag
What?
No, do not
Everybody listen closely
See how this bag is closed?
That's how it's supposed to be
This bag has the storm inside
We cannot let the treasure rumor fly
For nine days, I've stayed wide awake
Trying to make it home with no storm or tidal wave
I remain unopposed, the bag is still closed
And I'm getting closer to you
I can't wait to make some new memories
Time for me to be the father I never was
Why are my eyes and my heart and my soul so heavy?
I keep on trying to embrace you both
Why won't you let me?
So much has changed but I'm the same
Yes I'm the same
No!
Where's the storm taking us?
Help me close the bag
We can save whatever wind is left to use another day
Come on!
Poseidon
No
Poseidon, we meant no harm
We only hurt him to disarm him
We took no pleasure in his pain
We only wanted to escape
What have you done?
All I gotta do is open this bag
Eurylochus, go make sure this island is secure
There's only so much left we can endure
Whatever you need to say can wait some more
Of that, I'm sure
What was it?
What?
Damn
We have to go save them
Of course I'd like to leave now, of course I'd like to run
But I can hardly sleep now knowing everything we've done
There's no length I wouldn't go if it was you I had to save
I can only hope you'd do the same
Who goes there?
Hermes?
Ah
(Oh) Wouldn't you like a taste of the power?
Wouldn't you like to use more than words?
(Oh) Deep in the night, the fight lasts for hours
You can be hurt or you can beat her
(Oh) Wouldn't you like to have some of the magic?
Wouldn't you like your outcome preferred?
(Oh) Deep in the night, the fight can be tragic
I'll help you conquer her
Hermes, thank you
Lady of the palace, sorry that I ask this
But I hope that I've been misinformed
I sent out some scouts to take a look around through
Here and they wound up at your door
Through the years we seldom
Get a warm welcome, so
I must ask just to be sure
Did you do something to them?
You turned them into pigs
I don't mean to tip your scale but
You will fail at
Placing any spells on me
I just ate a flower
One that claims your power
So you better cower now and flee
Then I must be a god like you
Cause I got this root from the ground with my bare hands
Okay, fine, yes, but regardless
You and I are now evenly matched
Our fates are intertwined, they're attached
I've got people to protect, friends I can't neglect
So now there is no turning back
You've made your one wrong move, now you're done for
I will be the one to prove that you're done for
Not even a spell saves you, cause you're done for
Oh, you better run or soon you will be done for
You've lost
I'm not sure I follow
Who's to say, with the mistakes I've made, Don't be afraid
That they will be th? last Think of your past
Mistakes I ever mak?? Don't break when
There is so much power, so much power
But there's no puppet here, here
This is the price we pay to love, I'm just a man
There is no line never enough, I'm just a man
So much power, so much power, forgive me
But there's no puppet here
Friends, Circe's instructions were clear
No matter what we hear
Until we find the prophet
My comrades, this land confuses your mind
So no matter who we find
Good
All I hear are screams, every time I dare to close my eyes
I no longer dream, only nightmares of those who've died
Nothing's what it seems
Nothing's what it seems
And here in The Underworld, the past seems close behind
This land confuses your mind
All I hear are screams, every time I dare to close my eyes
I no longer dream, only nightmares of those who've died
Nothing's what it seems
Nothing's what it seems
But in The Underworld, the past seems close behind
I keep thinking of the infant from that night
I keep thinking of the infant from that night
What?
How has everything been turned against us?
How did suffering become so endless?
How am I to reunite with my estranged?
Do I need to change?
I'm surrounded by the souls of those I've lost
I'm the only whose line I haven't crossed
What if the greatest threat we'll find across the sea
Is me?
What if I'm the monster?
What if I'm in the wrong?
What if I'm the problem that's been hiding all along?
What if I'm the one who killed you
Every time I caved to guilt?
What if I've been far too kind to foes
But a monster to ourselves?
What if I'm the monster
Is the cyclops struck with guilt when he kills?
Is he up in the middle of the night?
Or does he end my men to avenge his friend
And then sleep knowing he has done him right?
When the witch turns men to pigs to protect her nymphs
Is she going insane?
Or did she learn to be colder when she got older and now she saves them the pain?
When a god comes down and makes a fleet drown
Is he scared that he's doing something wrong?
Or does he keep us in check so we must respect him
And now no one dares to piss him off?
Does a soldier use a wooden horse to kill sleeping Trojans cause he is vile?
Or does he throw away his remorse and save more lives with guile
If I became the monster, and threw that guilt away
Would that make us stronger?
Would it keep our foes at bay?
If I became the monster to everyone but us
And made sure we got home again
Who would care if we're unjust
If I became the
Oh, ruthlessness is mercy upon ourselves
And deep down I know this well
I lost my best friend
I lost my mentor, my mom
500 men gone, this can't go on
I must get to see Penelope and Telemachus
So if we must sail through dangerous oceans and beaches
I'll go where Poseidon won't reach us
And if I gotta drop another infant from a wall
In an instant so we all don't die
Then I'll become the
Monster
I will deal the blow
And I'll become the
Monster
Like none they've ever known
So what if I'm the
Monster
Lurking deep below
I must become the
Monster
And then we'll make it home
More than you know
Penelope, I’ve told you this before
You know I’m afraid of the water
Oh, I would
But I’d be suffering trying to float the whole time
Oh, as good as it sounds, right here I’m just fin?
You know that I pr?fer my feet on the ground
Fine, but only if you answer a question or two
Okay, so let’s say I was on the run or hiding…
From I don’t know Poseidon…
And let’s say he blocked the way home with giant waves and giant storms
How am I to evade him?
How am I to get home?
Which route should I take?
Where am I supposed to go?
No...
But Scylla has a cost
Penelope, why?
You know I’m too shy and terrified
Oh, for you, I would die, but can't you let me stay dry?
You should come onto the ship
We'll jump at the same time
Ah, the things I do for you
Let's cut this charade, you are no wife of mine
You've been tryna take my life this whole time
I know underwater, there are packs of you hiding
Yeah, I know exactly what you are: a siren
My real wife knows I'm not scared of the water
And my real wife knows I don't have a daughter
But while you were so focused on turning my men into snacks
You didn't notice that your friends got snatched
We are a different beast now
We ar? the ones who feast now
No mor? of us decease, 'cause we won't take more suffering from you
We are the man-made monsters
We are the ones who conquer
You are a threat no longer
We won't take more suffering from you
We've been away from home for about 12 years or so
First we slayed in our own war
And now, we're here with more foes
While on the run from Poseidon
We found a ship with no crew
I realised nearby, there were sirens
Singing sailors to their dooms
We filled our ears with beeswax
That's how we resist your song
You pretended to be my wife, so I just played along
I read your lips and phrases
Scanning for information
Sirens know about every route and horizon
Now I know how to get back to my island
Why?
So you can kill the next group of sailors in this part of the sea?
Nah, you wouldn't have spared me
I made a mistake like this and almost cost my life
I can't take more risks of not seeing my wife
Cut off their tails! We're ending this now
Throw their bodies back in the water
Let them drown
Kill them all!
Kill them all!
Kill them all!
Kill 'em all!
Row for your lives!
I can't
Lower your weapon
Don't make m? fight you, brother, you know you'd have done th? same
I am not letting you get in my way
She's my wife
I'm not your man
Hell no, I could kill you where you stand
I'm no pet, I'm a married man
Goddess?
No, no
I don't belong here
There's something wrong here
I won't be drawn to love in paradise
Not till the end of time, there is no way
Calypso
I love you
But not in the way that you want me to
Hermes?
So you're the one who talked to Calypso?
Why are you here?
If your plan's so great then why'd you wait to say it?
Alright, I'm in, what do I do?
You must be who Hermes mentioned
A monster here to block my way
I'd like to hurry up and end this
So if you don't have much to say
Then oh, bring it on
I'm not dying here, I'm still fighting here
I'm holding on
Til I see it through, til I've beaten you
I already know your tactics
When you swallow you attack with whirlpools that attract prey
But I see a disadvantage, cause I don't even have to kill you
I'll just have to avoid you
See, if you don't spit it out soon, all that water will destroy you
Oh, bring it on
Til you're out of breath, til there's nothing left
I'm holding on
Til I'm in the clear, til I'm out of here, oh
Wait
Stop this, please
NO
Aren't you tired, Poseidon?
It's been 8 years, how long will this go?
We're both hurting from losses
So why not leave this here and just go home?
I don't think you seem to get it
I can't afford to die
'Cause I will get back to my son
And I will get back to my wife
For every comrade, every one of my friends
Almost all of whom were slaughtered by your hand
Six hundred strike
You're goin' to call off that storm
Exactly
How does it feel to be helpless? (Argh)
How does it feel to know pain? (Ugh)
I watched my friends die in horror (Ah-ah)
Crying as they were all slain (Ugh)
I heard their final moments (Argh)
Calling their captain in vain (Ugh)
Look what you turned me into (Ah-ah)
Look what we've become (Ugh, enough)
All of the pain that I've been through (Stop)
Haven't I suffered enough? (Stop)
You didn't stop when I begged you
Told me to close my heart (You)
You said the world was dark (Monster)
Didn't you say that ruthlessness is mercy upon our—
Next to my wife
You don't think I know my own palace?
I built it
Oh my son, look how much you've grown
Oh my boy, the sweetest joy I've known
Twenty years ago I held you in my arms
How time has flown, oh
Used to say I'd make the storm clouds cry for you
Used to say I'd capture wind and sky for you
Held you in my arms prepared to die for you, oh
How times has flown
I can only wonder
What your world has been
Things you've had to suffer
And the strength you hold within
All I've ever wanted
Was to reunite with my own
20 years we've wandered
But today you're not alone
My son, I'm finally home!
Penelope
[ODYSSEUS] (opens the door of the bedroom)
I am not the man you fell in love with
I am not the man you once adored
I am not your kind and gentle husband
And I am not the love you knew before
Would you fall in love with me again
If you knew all I've done?
The things I cannot change
Would you love me all the same?
I know that you've been waiting, waiting for love
Left a trail of red on every island
As I traded friends like objects, I could use
Hurt more lives than I can count on my hands
But all of that was to bring me back to you
So tell me
Would you fall in love with me again
If you knew all I've done?
The things I can't undo
I am not the man you knew
I know that you've been waiting, waiting
How could you say this?
I had built that wedding bed with my blood and sweat
Carved it into the olive tree where we first met
A symbol of our love everlasting
Do you realize what you have asked me?
The only way to move it is to cut it from its roots
Penelope
Penelope
Waiting, waiting (Penelope)
Waiting, waiting
Waiting, oh
For you
Twenty years
I love you
