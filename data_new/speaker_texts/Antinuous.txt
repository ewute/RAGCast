Fight, little wolf, fight
Wanna entertain me?
Bite, little wolf, bite
Let's see how you take this
Strike, little wolf, strike
Wanna be a man? Then
Fight, little wolf, fight, little wolf, fight
You've made your worst mistake here, might be your last one too
You'll have run out of bones to break when you and I are through
I'll teach you all the lessons your daddy never could
This cruel world doesn't give out presents just for being good
So
Fight, little wolf, fight
Wanna entertain m??
Bite, little wolf, bite
L?t's see how you take this
Strike, little wolf, strike
Wanna be a man? Then
Fight, little wolf, fight, little wolf, fight
Or die, little wolf, die
Don't you know it's fight or
Fly, little wolf, fly
All because you had to
Try, little wolf try
Run away before you
Die, little wolf, die, little wolf, die
Screw this competition, we've been here for hours
None of us can string this, we don't?have?the power
Screw this?damn challenge, no more delays
Can't you?guys see we're being played?
This is how they
Hold us down while the throne gets colder
Hold us down while we slowly age
Hold us down while the boy gets bolder
Where the hell is our pride and our rage?
Here and now, there's a chance for action
Here and now, we can take control
Here and now, burn it down to ashes
Channel the fire inside your soul
Hold us down
While the throne gets colder
Hold us down
While we slowly age
Hold us down
While the boy gets bolder
Where the hell is our pride and our rage?
Here and now
There's a chance for action
Here and now
We can take control
Here and now
Burn it down to ashes
Channel the fire inside your soul
Haven't you noticed who's missing?
Don't you know the prince is not around
I heard he's on a diplomatic mission
And I heard today he comes back to town, so
I say we gather near the beaches
I say we wait 'til he arrives
Then, when he docks his ship, we can breach it
Let us leave now, today we can strike and
Hold him down 'til the boy stops shaking
Hold him down while I slit his throat
Hold him down while I slowly break his pride, his trust, his faith, and his bones
Cut him down into tiny pieces
Throw him down in the great below
When the crown wonders where the prince is
Only the ocean and I will know
And when the deed is done
The queen will have no one to
Stop us from breaking her bedroom door
Stop us from taking her love and more
And then we'll
Hold her down while her gate is open
Hold her down while I get a taste
Hold her down while we share her spoils
I will not let any part go to waste
Here and now, there's a chance for action
Here and now, we can take control
Here and now, burn it down to ashes
Channel the fire inside your soul and
Hold 'em down, hold 'em down
Hold 'em down, hold 'em down
