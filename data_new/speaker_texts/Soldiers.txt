Alright, my brothers, listen closely
Tonight, we make the Trojans pay
Ten years of war, they killed us slowly
But now we'll be the ones who slay
Think of your wives and your children
Your families wonder where you've been
They're growing old, and yet you're still here
Do what I say and you'll see them again
Yes sir!
Diomedes will lead the charge
Agamemnon will flank the guards
Menelaus will let our mates through the gates to take the whole city at large
Teucer will shoot any ambush attack
And Little Ajax will stay back
Nestor, secure Helen and protect her
Neo, avenge your father, kill the brothers of Hector!
Yes sir!
What do you live for?
What do you try for?
What do you wish for?
What do you fight for?
What do you live for?
What do you try for?
What do you wish for?
What do you fight for?
Six hundred men, six hundred men under my command
With only one goal in mind
Make it back alive to our homeland
Six hundred men, six hundred miles of open sea
But the problem's not the distance
It's what lies in between
And Ithaca's waiting Ithaca's waiting
My kingdom is waiting The kingdom is waiting
Penelope's waiting for me
So full speed ahead, full speed ahead
Captain, Eurylochus
Six hundred men Six hundred men
Six hundred men with big mouths to feed, and we've run out of supplies to eat
Curse the war, our food store's depleted
Six hundred men Six hundred men
Six hundred reasons to take what we can
So captain, what's the plan?
Captain, what's the plan?
Watch where the birds fly
Watch where the birds fly
They will lead us to land
They will lead us to land
There we'll hunt for food, my second in command
Now full speed ahead, full speed ahead
We're up, we're off, and away we go
We're up, we're off, and away we go (Full speed ahead)
We're up, we're off, and away we go
Give me 'til sunrise, and if we don't return
Then six hundred men can make this whole place burn
Now full speed ahead
Full speed ahead
Full speed ahead
We're up, we're off, and away we go
We're up, we're off, and away we go
Full speed ahead
We're up, we're off, and away we go
We're up, we're off, and a-
Full speed ahead
No backup, no chance for support
So draw out your swords
Our foe must be thwarted right here and now
Show me how great is your will to survive
Six hundred lives at stake
It's just one life to take
And when we kill him then our journey’s over
No dying on me now
Defeat is not allowed
We must live through this day so
Fight, fight, fight
Surround him, surround him
Attack from behind, keep distance in mind
And stay in his blindspot and strike his heels, strike the heels
Show him that we're deadly, ha, ha
Exhaust him, exhaust him
Don't let him get close, he's strong but he's slow
He can't land a blow if we're out of reach
Find a breach
Stand up and fight for your lives
Six hundred lives at stake
It's just one life to take
And when we kill him then our journey’s over
Push forward
No dying on us now
Defeat is not allowed
We must live through this day so
Fight, fight, fight
Remember them
When the fire begins to fade
For the fallen and afraid
We are not to let them die in vain
Remember them
We're the ones who carry on
The flames of those who've gone
And our comrades will not die in vain
Let's kill him!
Yes sir
Remember them
When the fire begins to fade
For the fallen and afraid
We are not to let them die in vain
Remember them
We're the ones who carry on
The flames of those who've gone
And our comrades will not die in vain
Sir!
Brace for a storm
Storm
The likes of which we've never seen before
Brace for a storm
Storm
With home so close, we must keep pushing forward
Full speed ahead
Storm
Storm
We'll beat this storm
Storm
Storm, storm
Storm, storm
Storm, storm
Ruthlessness is (Captain) mercy upon our- Captain
Ruthlessness is (Captain) mercy upon our- Captain
Ruthlessness is (Captain) mercy upon our- Captain
Ruthlessness is (Captain)
Full speed ahead
Full speed ahead, until we find the prophet
All I hear are screams, every time I dare to close my eyes
I no longer dream, only nightmares of those who've died
Nothing's what it seems
Nothing's what it seems
And here in The Underworld, the past seems close behind
This land confuses your mind
All I hear are screams, every time I dare to close my eyes
I no longer dream, only nightmares of those who've died
Nothing's what it seems
Nothing's what it seems
But in The Underworld, the past seems close behind
I keep thinking of the infant from that night
I keep thinking of the infant from that night

How much longer must we suffer now?
How much longer must we push through doubt?
How much longer must we go about
Our lives like this when people die like this?
Woah
Eurylochus, Eurylochus, Eurylochus
Odysseus, Odysseus, Odysseus
There is no price he won't pay
